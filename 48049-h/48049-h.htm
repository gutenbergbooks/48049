<p class="p4">BEGINNINGS</p>


<p>I know that to the majority of people who merely regard the theatre
as a place for occasional recreation, it is a subject for amazement
that others can exist who, not belonging to the theatrical profession,
take an absorbing and lasting interest in the stage, and in those
actors and actresses who have made its past history glorious, as well
as in the artists who adorn and make it a delight in the present. I
wonder how many of us truly realise the weight of Charles Dickens's
words: "If any man were to tell me that he denied his acknowledgments
to the stage, I would simply put to him one question&mdash;whether he
remembered his first play?"</p>

<p>Not only freely, but with gratitude, I acknowledge my indebtedness
to the theatre, and it is certain that from that magic night when for
the first time I saw the glitter of the footlights and watched the rise
of the curtain, I entered upon a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
new and most fascinating life. Of course I was called "stage struck,"
and those who controlled me shook their heads, thought it a great pity,
and did their best to thwart my inclinations. Concerning the stage and
its attractions the parents of the "fifties" were less liberal-minded
than those of to-day, and they had an unhappy knack of talking over
the tendencies of their children with uncles and aunts who, without
meaning to do the least kindly thing for them, seemed to regard their
nephews and nieces as so many ready-made reprobates open to their
interfering condemnation. Oh! those terrible uncles and aunts! In his
pages the grand old novelist, Richardson, reflecting the manners of his
time, made (apparently well meaning) ogres of them; the good and ever
interesting Jane Austen only contrived to soften them down; and I hope
my "fifties" saw the fag-end of them, for to-day they prove themselves
to be reasonable and generous beings.</p>

<p>But, as I say, I was set down as "stage struck," and I had to
grow accustomed to the shoulder-shrug greeting of relatives, and the
admonition that my first duty was to consider my father and mother.
Never was anything so unfair. I was not in the ordinary sense of the
word "stage struck." I was not fool enough to think that I could shine
either as tragedian or comedian. I knew that a more prosaic life had
been planned out for me, and I was prepared to enter into it; but,
for a lurking fear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span> that I should "take to the stage" (neither I nor
my parents, nor my uncles and aunts, knew how this was to be done), I
found myself compelled to read my beloved play-books and chronicles of
great actors in private. When it was accidentally discovered that I
had attempted to write a play there was real family trouble, and I am
afraid that some of those who pretended to take interest in me wrote me
down as "no good."</p>

<p>No! It never could be understood that I really wanted to make a
study of an art that appealed to me more strongly than its sisters,
music and painting. Yet the three are so closely allied that in
devotedly following my first love I learnt to appreciate her kith and
kin. I pen these lines because I am certain that many others must have
felt as I did, and do; and, while doing justice to other claims upon
their life energies, have taken their keenest delight in the story of
the stage.</p>

<p>Yes; I am sure that to many of us the theatre has formed a
little world of its own&mdash;a little world that we can enjoy and
grasp&mdash;while the great world outside it is so apt to torture us
with its perplexities, and half kill us with its seeming cruelties.</p>

<p>And I think that the little world in which I and my brother
enthusiasts delight is all the more appreciated when we understand that
it, too, is beset with its anxieties and grievous disappointments, and
is far from the dazzling, soul-soothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
elysium we pictured in the halcyon days of our boyhood. Our hearts go
out all the more freely to the actors and actresses who warm them when
we realise that they, too, have their trials as well as their triumphs.
Our admiration is redoubled when it is leavened with sympathy. It is
all the more important, then, that our entertainers should know that
this feeling exists among those for whom they devote the work of their
lives.</p>

<p>The artistic temperament is always more or less self-tormenting, and
it is to be feared that my "little world," which shines so brightly
over our great one, where sorrow has daily to be met and borne, is in
itself a sorely troubled one.</p>

<p>In that strange French play which has our great English tragedian,
Edmund Kean, for its central figure, Alexandre Dumas, who knew
everything that could be known about the theatre, caused his actor-hero
to respond bitterly to the woman who loved him, and who opined that
all his troubles must vanish when he reflects that he is recognised
as the King of the Stage. "King! Yes, three times a week! King with
a tinselled sceptre, paste diamonds, and a pinchbeck crown. I rule a
kingdom of thirty-five feet, and subjects who are jealous of my power."
Then, when she asks, "Why do you not give it up?" he replies with
indignation, "Give up the stage? Ah! you don't realise that he who has
once donned the robe of Nessus cannot take it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
off without lacerating his flesh. <em>I</em> give up the
stage?&mdash;renounce its excitement?&mdash;its glitter?&mdash;its
triumphs? <em>I</em> give up my throne to another? Never! while I've
health and strength to walk the boards, and brains to interpret the
poetry I love. Remember, an actor cannot leave his work behind him.
He lives only in his own lifetime&mdash;his memory fades with the
generation to which he belongs, he must finish as he has begun, die
as he has lived&mdash;die, if fortune favours him, with the delicious
sound of applause in his ears. But those who have not set foot upon a
dangerous path do well to avoid it."</p>

<p>The actor's complaint that his fame, however great, cannot be
recollected many years beyond the time in which he lived is a very old
one, and it must have been with this mournful view in his mind that
David Garrick wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"The painter dead, yet still he charms the eye;</div>
  <div class="i0">While England lives his fame can never die.</div>
  <div class="i0">But he who struts his hour upon the stage</div>
  <div class="i0">Can scarce extend his fame for half an age;</div>
  <div class="i0">Nor pen nor pencil can the actor save,</div>
  <div class="i0">The art and artist share one common grave."</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The volumes of theatrical history and biography that have been
written and become popular since Garrick's day, prove that this is not
wholly true, that we are not ungrateful to those who have instructed
and amused us on the stage, and that we shall not willingly let their
honoured memories die.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
The fact that the depressing feeling that they and their work will
"soon be forgotten" still exists among members of the theatrical
profession is, I venture to believe, some excuse for records such as
this being issued during the lifetime of the artist, while memory is
green, and appreciation can be written at first hand. Even if such
works give little or no pleasure to their living subjects, it may be
borne in mind that they will probably be of service to those future
stage historians who will permanently inscribe their names on the
tablets of fame.</p>

<p>The passionate declaration of Dumas's Kean that, despite his
troubles and torments, he would never while life was in him leave the
stage, is an old tale. Actors, as a rule, love to die in harness, and
it was in the full knowledge of this that T. W. Robertson caused his
stage David Garrick to reply to Alderman Ingot, when he offered to
double or treble his income if he would abandon his profession, "Leave
the stage? Impossible!" Poor Sothern, who created the part, was staying
with me when his physician wrote saying that if he wished to prolong
his life he must give up all work. After a moment's depression the
actor with a sudden impulse snatched a portrait of himself as Garrick
from my wall, tore it from its frame, and in a large, firm hand, wrote
beneath it: "Leave the stage? Impossible!"</p>

<p>I have no doubt that Charles Wyndham, who, after Sothern's death,
took up the part, and made it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
one of the greatest successes of the modern stage, feels the full
import of the words every time he speaks them.</p>

<p>And if the actors suffer so do the dramatists, or at all events the
would-be dramatists. In an admirable little book called "Play Writing,"
the author gives sound advice to the ever-growing, ever-complaining
army of the unacted.</p>

<p>"Dramatic authorship," he says, "is to the profession of literature
as reversing is to waltzing&mdash;an agony within a misery. A man who
means to be a dramatist must be prepared for a life of never-ending
strife and fret&mdash;a brain and heart-exhausting struggle from
the hour when, full of hope, he starts off with his first farce in
his pocket to the days when, involuntarily taking the advice of one
of the early masters of his own craft&mdash;to wit, old rare Ben
Jonson&mdash;he leaves 'the loathed stage and the more loathsome
age.'"</p>

<p>And again, this anonymous but evidently experienced writer (I quote
from him freely) declares that any dramatist could tales unfold of
disappointments and delays, of hopes deferred, of chances dashed from
the grasp at the very moment they seemed clutched, of weary waitings
rewarded by failure, of enterprise and effort leading only to defeat,
of hard work winning only loss. It has been suggested, too, in this
connection, that any one sufficiently interested in such matters should
make a list of the plays that in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
"preliminary paragraphs" are spoken of as "about to be produced,"
and which are never heard of again,&mdash;and that it should then be
remembered that each of these unborn plays represents a very heavy
heart being carried about for many a long day under somebody or other's
waistcoat,&mdash;and means that somebody or other feels very sick and
hopeless as he moves about his little world, trying to appear careless
and to laugh it off,&mdash;that somebody or other grows very tired
and weary of the struggle, and almost wishes now and then that it was
over.</p>

<p>But to the young playgoer who sits in front these troubles are
unknown, and to him the theatre may well appear as the realisation of
Fairyland, and a veritable Palace of Fancy.</p>

<p>I believe there is another reason why men, if they would own it,
have come to be grateful to the stage. Has it not to many been the
scene in which they have first learned what it is to love? They may
never have spoken to the divinities who inspired their boyish ardour,
but they have been better and purer for it, and cherish the sweet
recollection of it to their old age.</p>

<p>Cannot we all enter into the feelings of young virgin-hearted Arthur
Pendennis when he first saw the lovely Miss Fotheringay on the boards?
Cannot we all understand how he followed the woman about and about, and
when she was off the stage the house became a blank? and how, when the
play was over,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
the curtain fell upon him like a pall? Poor Pendennis!
He hardly knew what he felt that night. "It was something overwhelming,
maddening, delicious; a fever of wild joy and undefined longing."</p>

<p>And then how he woke the next morning, when, at an early hour, the
rooks began to caw from the little wood beyond his bedroom windows;
and at that very instant, and as his eyes started open, the beloved
image was in his mind. "My dear boy," he heard her say, "you were in
a sound sleep, and I would not disturb you: but I have been close by
your pillow all this while; and I don't intend that you shall leave me.
I am Love! I bring with me fever and passion; wild longing, maddening
desire; restless craving and seeking. Many a long day ere this I heard
you calling out for me; and behold now I am come."</p>

<p>Yes, I am convinced that most of us have felt, rejoiced, and
suffered as Arthur Pendennis did, and that we first caught the fever
from the footlights. The attack may have been acute, and, in its
apparent hopelessness, painful. But recovery brought with it the sweet
knowledge that we had been permitted to understand the meaning of
Heaven's greatest gift to mankind&mdash;Love.</p>

<p>I know that there are many who only go to the theatre to carp and
cavil, and impotently point out that if the management of the playhouse
and the acting of all the parts had been placed in their hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
a much better performance would have been provided; but I believe
that even these would love to recall the dreamy illusions of their
youth. Perhaps, in the hours of their solitude (and silence!), they do
so. Why, in their soured maturity, these unhappy, self-imposed, and
absolutely unconvincing critics go to the theatre to be (on their own
declaration) bored and disgusted is to me a mystery. It is all the more
a mystery when I know that they can thoroughly enjoy a variety hall.</p>

<p>Of course, everything depends on the spirit in which we go to the
theatre.</p>

<p>Do you remember the difference of opinion expressed between
Steerforth and David Copperfield on the night when they renewed the
acquaintance of their boyhood at the Golden Cross Hotel? David had been
to Covent Garden Theatre, and had there seen "Julius Cæsar." "To have,"
he says, "all those noble Romans alive before me, and walking in and
out for my entertainment, instead of being the stern task-masters they
had been at school, was a most novel and delightful effect. But the
mingled reality and mystery of the whole show, the influence upon me of
the poetry, the lights, the music, the company; the smooth, stupendous
changes of glittering and brilliant scenery were so dazzling, and
opened up such illimitable regions of delight, that when I came out
into the rainy street I felt as if I had come from the clouds, where I
had been leading a romantic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
life for ages, to a bawling, splashing, link-lighted,
umbrella-struggling, hackney-coach jostling, patten-clicking,
muddy, miserable world."</p>

<p>And when he told the superior Steerforth of his innocent enjoyment,
he had to listen to the laughing reply:&mdash;</p>

<p>"My dear young Davy&mdash;you are a very daisy. The daisy of the
field, at sunrise, is not fresher than you are! I have been at Covent
Garden, too, and there never was a more miserable business."</p>

<p>In my own mind I am convinced that if we will we can always, to
our great advantage and delight, keep up the enthusiasm of David
Copperfield;&mdash;that to some of us the theatre, even when we know
all about the fret and turmoil of the actor's life together with the
tricks of the stage, may from boyhood to old age remain a Palace of
Fancy.</p>

<p>And have we not in the heroine of these pages&mdash;Ellen
Terry&mdash;the very embodiment of Fancy,&mdash;the true Princess of
our Palace, one of the Queens of our little stage world? Other great
artists have delighted us with the perfection of their impersonations,
but there is in the method or inspiration of Ellen Terry something so
ethereal that in many of her characters she stands alone.</p>

<p>If the drama is indeed the Cinderella of the arts, then Ellen Terry
must have been touched by the magic wand of a Fairy Godmother so that
she might dazzle the Prince's ballroom with her beauty, radiance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
and ever fragrant sweetness, and win the admiration of his guests.</p>

<p>But those who thoughtlessly and even contemptuously call the
drama "Cinderella" probably do not know the origin of the familiar
fairy-tale&mdash;how the little kitchen maid is Ushas, the Dawn Maiden
of the Aryans, and the Aurora of the Greeks; and how the Prince is
the Sun, ever seeking to make the Dawn his bride; and how the envious
stepmother and sisters are the Clouds and the Night, which vainly
strive to keep the Sun and the Dawn apart. It is pleasant to think
of Cinderella as the Dawn Maiden. Poor little lady! She has suffered
considerably in her transplantation to English soil.</p>

<p>To me the magic word "Fancy" has ever been associated with the pure
art of Ellen Terry, and whenever I see her on the stage the lines of
John Keats comes rippling through my mind:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"Oh! sweet Fancy! let her loose;</div>
  <div class="i0">Everything is spoilt by use;</div>
  <div class="i0">Where's the cheek that doth not fade,</div>
  <div class="i0">Too much gazed at? Where's the maid</div>
  <div class="i0">Whose lip mature is ever new?</div>
  <div class="i0">Where the eye, however blue,</div>
  <div class="i0">Doth not weary? Where's the face</div>
  <div class="i0">One would meet in every place?</div>
  <div class="i0">Where's the voice, however soft,</div>
  <div class="i0">One would hear so very oft?</div>
  <div class="i0">At a touch sweet pleasure melteth</div>
  <div class="i0">Like to bubbles when rain pelteth.</div>
  <div class="i0">Let, then, winged Fancy find</div>
  <div class="i0">Thee a mistress to her mind;</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Dulcet-eyed as Ceres' daughter</div>
  <div class="i0">Ere the god of Torment taught her</div>
  <div class="i0">How to frown and how to chide;</div>
  <div class="i0">With a waist and with a side</div>
  <div class="i0">White as Hebe's, when her zone</div>
  <div class="i0">Slipt its golden clasp, and down</div>
  <div class="i0">Fell her kirtle to her feet,</div>
  <div class="i0">While she held the goblet sweet,</div>
  <div class="i0">And Jove grew languid. Break the mesh</div>
  <div class="i0">Of the Fancy's silken leash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Quickly break her prison string,</div>
  <div class="i0">And such joys as these she'll bring&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Let the winged Fancy roam,</div>
  <div class="i0">Pleasure never is at home."</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But it must be recorded that Fancy, as let loose and impersonated
by Ellen Terry, is taken from the theatre in thousands of hearts, and
that it enters into many a home circle where the memory of it gives
unbounded and enduring pleasure. Into the simple homes of those who
elbow each other in the gallery, as well as into the luxurious mansions
of the wealthy folk who sit at their ease in the stalls. In many a
workman's dwelling I have come across a carefully framed photograph
of Ellen Terry, and a treasured play-bill kept in commemoration of a
never-to-be-forgotten evening enjoyed in her realms of Fancy.</p>

<p>But she did not drop from cloudland to delight us. Her great
achievements have been won&mdash;as all great achievements are
won&mdash;by early training, deep and constant study, hard work, and
possibly, above all, by family tradition.</p>

<p>In theatrical lore the name of Terry is, indeed, an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
old and honoured one. In Lockhart's beautiful biography of Sir Walter
Scott, and again in the happily published Diary of the Magician of the
North, we read much of the energetic Daniel Terry who was for many
years connected with the Edinburgh stage, and who subsequently joined
Yates in a memorable management of the Adelphi Theatre. Daniel Terry,
with the appreciative eye of the true actor, set his heart upon making
stage versions of the Waverley Novels, and though at first Scott (in
common with all great novelists) objected to this process, it was
subsequently allowed, and adapter and author became friends. It was
in the spring of 1816 that Terry produced a dramatic piece entitled
"Guy Mannering," which met with great success, and is still from time
to time seen. "What share," says Lockhart, "the novelist had in this
first specimen of what he used to call the art of 'Terryfying,' I
cannot exactly say; but his correspondence shows that the pretty song
of the Lullaby was not his only contribution to it; and I infer that
he had taken the trouble to modify the plot, and rearrange, for stage
purposes, a considerable part of the original dialogue."</p>

<p>Of the intimacy that commenced and grew between the poet and the
playwright, Lockhart records:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It was at a rehearsal of 'The Family Legend of Joanna Baillie'
that Scott was first introduced to another theatrical performer, who
ere long acquired a large share of his regard and confidence&mdash;Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Daniel Terry. He had received a good education, and been regularly
trained as an architect; but abandoned that profession at an early
period of life, and was now beginning to attract attention as a
valuable actor in Henry Siddons's company. Already he and the
Ballantynes were constant companions, and through his familiarity
with them Scott had abundant opportunities of appreciating his many
excellent and agreeable qualities. He had the manners and feelings
of a gentleman. Like John Kemble, he was deeply skilled in the old
literature of the drama, and he rivalled Scott's own enthusiasm for the
antiquities of <i>vertu</i>. Their epistolary correspondence in after days
was frequent, and none so well illustrates many of the poet's minor
tastes and habits. As their letters lie before me they appear as if
they had all been penned by the same hand. Terry's idolatry of his new
friend induced him to imitate his writing so zealously that Scott used
to say, if he were called upon to swear to any document, the utmost he
could venture to attest would be, that it was either in his own hand
or Terry's. The actor, perhaps unconsciously, mimicked him in other
matters with hardly inferior pertinacity. His small lively features had
acquired, before I knew him, a truly ludicrous cast of Scott's graver
expression; he had taught his tiny eyebrow the very trick of the poet's
meditative frown; and, to crown all, he so habitually affected his tone
and accent that, though a native of Bath, a stranger could hardly have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
doubted he must be a Scotchman. These things afforded all their
acquaintance much diversion; but perhaps no Stoic could have helped
being secretly gratified by seeing a clever and sensible man convert
himself into a living type and symbol of admiration."</p>

<p>In the pages of his fascinating Diary (or "Journal") Scott
records&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<em>October 20, 1826</em> (London).&mdash;At breakfast, Crofton
Croker, author of the 'Irish Fairy Tales.' Something like Tom Moore.
There were also Terry, Allan Cunningham, Newton, and others."</p>

<p>"<em>October 21, 1826.</em>&mdash;We returned to a hasty dinner in Pall
Mall, and then hurried away to see honest Dan Terry's house, called
the Adelphi Theatre, where we saw 'The Pilot,' from the American novel
of that name. It is extremely popular, the dramatist having seized on
the whole story, and turned the odious and ridiculous parts, assigned
by the original author to the British, against the Yankees themselves.
There is a quiet effrontery in this that is of a rare and peculiar
character. The Americans were so much displeased, that they attempted
a row&mdash;which rendered the piece doubly attractive to the seamen
at Wapping, who came up and crowded the house night after night to
support the honour of the British flag.... I was, however, glad to see
honest Dan's theatre as full seemingly as it could hold. The heat was
dreadful, and Anne was so very unwell that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
she was obliged to be carried into Terry's house&mdash;a curious
dwelling, no larger than a squirrel's cage, which he has contrived
to squeeze out of the vacant spaces of the theatre, and which is
accessible by a most complicated combination of staircases and small
passages. Here we had rare good porter and oysters after the play, and
found Anne much better. She had attempted too much; indeed, I myself
was much fatigued."</p></blockquote>

<p>Later comes a sadder note:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<em>February 3, 1827.</em>&mdash;Terry has been pressed by
Gibson for my debt to him. That I may get
managed."</p></blockquote>

<p>And again&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<em>April 15, 1828.</em>&mdash;Got the lamentable news that
Terry is totally bankrupt. This is a most unexpected blow, though
his carelessness about money matters was very great. God help the
poor fellow! He has been ill-advised to go abroad, but now returns to
stand the storm&mdash;old debts, it seems, with principal and interest
accumulated, and all the items which load a falling man. And wife, such
a good and kind creature, and children. Alack! alack! I sought out his
solicitor. There are £7000 or more to pay, and the only fund his share
in the Adelphi Theatre, worth £5000 and upwards, and then so fine a
chance of independence lost. That comes of not being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
explicit with his affairs. The theatre was a most flourishing
concern. I looked at the books, and since have seen Yates. The ruin
is inevitable, but I think they will not keep him in prison, but let
him earn his bread by his very considerable talents. I shall lose the
whole or part of £5000, which I lent him, but that is the last of my
concern."</p></blockquote>

<p>And then follow these interesting and touching entries:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<em>May 8, 1828.</em>&mdash;I have been of material assistance to
poor Terry in his affairs."</p>

<p>"<em>June 18, 1829.</em>&mdash;Poor Terry is totally prostrated by a
paralytic affection. Continuance of existence not to be wished for."</p>

<p>"<em>July 9, 1829.</em>&mdash;Many recollections die with poor
Terry."</p></blockquote>

<p>Of his semi-partnership with his actor-friend, Sir Walter Scott, in
a humorous mood, wrote:&mdash;"I have been made a dramatist whether I
would or no. I believe my muse would be <i>Terry</i>fied into treading the
stage even if I should write a sermon."</p>

<p>Benjamin Terry, the father of the clever family who form the subject
of these pages, became in his time very popular in Edinburgh, and it
was there that he attracted the attention of Charles Kean, and obtained
his offer for the actor's Mecca&mdash;London. But his experience had
no doubt been earned in some of the old "circuits" that were the
theatrical schools of his early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
days, and turned out many a true artist. The actors and actresses who
thus served their apprenticeship to the stage assuredly had rough
times of it, but they had for the most part joined the profession
for the love of it&mdash;they adored Shakespeare and the authors of
the "legitimate drama,"&mdash;and, in spite of tedious journeys from
town to town, poor business, and bad theatrical accommodation at the
end of them, looked forward to and enjoyed the evening's performance.
Enthusiasm and hard work led to their reward, and many a poor
strolling-player became a shining light on the London stage.</p>

<p>When Ben Terry went on circuit, travelling actors were in better
plight than they were in the days of poor Roger Kemble and his devoted
wife, who travelled from town to town, and village to village, after
the manner and under the difficulties and disadvantages of the
time,&mdash;at some places being received with gracious favour, and at
others treated like lepers and threatened with the stocks and whipping
at the cart's tail, according as the great people were liberal minded
or puritanical. But this struggling, persecuted Roger Kemble lived to
see his daughter, Mrs. Siddons, and his son, John Philip, the stage
idols of their day; and if sometimes his perturbed spirit could revisit
Hereford (one of the cities of his early sorrows) he would realise the
happy fact that the portraits of his never-to-be-forgotten family hold
the places of honour on the Deanery walls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>Since to the often ridiculed circuits of a bygone day we can trace
such actors as the Kembles, the Robertsons, and the Terrys, surely we
should hold them in honoured memory?</p>

<p>Dickens turned them to comic account when he conceived the
impossible but immortal Crummles family; but he put the true ring into
the warm-hearted old manager's heart and voice when on bidding farewell
to Nicholas, he said, "We were a very happy little company. You and I
never had a word. I shall be very glad to-morrow morning to think that
I saw you again, but now I almost wish you hadn't come."</p>

<p>It is pleasant to think that in their own way the circuit players
all formed happy little companies. To enjoy the work of our choice is,
in spite of any drawbacks, one of the greatest sources of happiness.</p>

<p>My esteemed friend, John Coleman, whose memory carries him back to
the days of long ago, has told me that he met Mr. and Mrs. Ben Terry
on the Worcester Circuit. He remembers the former as a handsome,
fine-looking brown-haired man, and the wife as a tall, graceful
creature, with an abundance of fair hair, and with big blue eyes set
in a charming face. Years and years passed before he met his old-time
friend again; but at the memorable banquet given to Henry Irving on
the eve of his departure for his first tour in America, a grey-haired,
dignified old gentleman, who sat next to him, told him that he was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
"Ben Terry" of the dead and gone Worcester Circuit, and introduced him
to his grandson, Gordon Craig.</p>

<p>On that evening the old actor had good reason to be proud, for he
could boast of being the father of one of the most gifted and cultured
of histrionic families. "Think of it," writes Mr. Clement Scott, "Kate,
with her lovely figure and comely features; Ellen, with her quite
indescribable charm; Marion, with a something in her deeper, more
tender, and more feminine than either of them; Florence, who became
lovelier as a woman than as a girl; and the brothers Fred and Charles,
both splendid specimens of the athletic Englishman."</p>

<p>It was while the parent Terrys were fulfilling an engagement at
Coventry&mdash;the interesting City of the Three Tall Spires&mdash;that
their daughter Ellen was born. This was in the February of 1848, and
quite a little feud has taken place between some of the good people
of Coventry as to the precise house in which the important event took
place. That it was on the 27th day of the second month of the year, and
that the street was Market Street, one and all seem agreed, but several
inhabitants of that thoroughfare have laid claim to be the occupiers,
if not the owners of the shrine. No. 5 and No. 26 are the chief
claimants of the honour (and in all seriousness it is no small honour),
but as an "old nurse," who should know something about such things, has
declared for No. 5, it stands first favourite; and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
fact in its favour is that in the days of 1848 it was a popular
lodging-house for actors. One can sympathise with No. 26, but the
general vote must be given to No. 5. After all, it does not much
matter, for who knows what changes have taken place in the old street
during the last fifty years? Perhaps (but for pious pilgrims this is
a dreadful thought!) <i>even the door numbers may have been changed</i>!
With a few exceptions the birthplaces of celebrities are apt to be
disappointing. My enthusiasm for famous artists once took me to Brecon
so that I might visit the "Shoulder of Mutton" Inn, in which Sarah
Kemble was born, but, though it was properly inscribed, it was not
the interesting old tavern of my imagination, and manifest modern
"improvements" made me content with a brief gaze at its exterior. It
was at the beautiful Trinity Church at Coventry, on the 26th November
1773, that Sarah Kemble was married to Henry Siddons, the handsome
young actor from Birmingham; and this brings me back to "leafy
Warwickshire" (Warwickshire-men never forget that it is Shakespeare's
county), and the Coventry of Ellen Terry's birthday in 1848.</p>

<p>Now let me show how easily, by those who care about such things,
theatrical history may be traced.</p>

<p>Ellen Terry, as will soon be seen, was destined to make her earliest
(though childish) successes with Charles Kean. Charles Kean had acted
with his renowned father, Edmund Kean. Edmund Kean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
had in his childhood figured as one of the imps who danced around the
cauldron in John Philip Kemble's revival of "Macbeth." Roger Kemble,
the father of John Philip and Sarah Siddons, was the son of a Kemble
who had been engaged by and was associated with Betterton. After "the
King had got his own again" Betterton was acknowledged to be the
legitimate successor to Burbage. Burbage was the first of our great
tragic actors, and was the original performer of the greater number
of Shakespeare's heroes&mdash;of Coriolanus, Brutus, Romeo, Hamlet,
Othello, Lear, Shylock, Macbeth, Prince Hal, Henry V., and Richard III.
In "Hamlet" Shakespeare enacted the touching character of the Ghost to
the Prince created by Burbage; and so, in a rough and somewhat "House
that Jack Built" fashion, the connection of such famous histrionic
families as the Terrys can be traced back to the Elizabethan days, to
Shakespeare, and the actors of his period.</p>

<p>We may now follow the Ben Terrys and their pretty children to
the London Princess's Theatre, where the experienced actor not only
played many parts but became assistant stage-manager to Charles Kean.
Considering the magnitude of the productions aimed at, this must have
been a post of no small importance and responsibility. When the famous
series of Shakespearean revivals demanded the appearance of clever
children, what was more natural than a conference between Kean and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
trusted lieutenant, and the recommendation by the fond father of the
engagement of his gifted little daughters, Kate and Ellen? Their
services were secured, and at a very early period of their lives they
began to make stage history. Their achievements in the once famous
Oxford Street playhouse will be recorded in the next chapter. In the
meantime it is pleasant to touch upon some of Ellen Terry's impressions
of her earliest childhood.</p>

<p>In a charming series of papers entitled "Stray Memories,"
contributed by her to the <cite>New Review</cite> about ten years ago, she thus
delightfully as well as dutifully recalls memories of her father
and mother. "It must be remembered," she says, "that my sister and
I had the advantage of exceedingly clever and conscientious parents
who spared no pains to bring out and perfect any talents that we
possessed. My father was a very charming elocutionist, and my mother
read Shakespeare beautifully, and then both were very fond of us and
saw our faults with eyes of love, though they were unsparing in their
corrections. And, indeed, they had need of all their patience, for, for
my own part, I know I was a most troublesome, wayward pupil. However,
'the labour we delight in physics pain,' and I hope, too, that my more
staid sister 'made it up to them.'"</p>

<p>Can anything be prettier than this daintily recorded, and no doubt
uncalled for admission?</p>

<p>With one more glimpse of her home-life in childhood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
I will bring this chapter of "Beginnings" to a close. Some time ago
it occurred to those who are responsible for that always sprightly
journal, <i>The Referee</i>, to ask some stage celebrities to contribute to
their Yule-tide number their impressions of Christmas in their early
days&mdash;of Christmas, the great and never-to-be-forgotten holiday of
little folk.</p>

<p>And this is what Ellen Terry conjured up:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Really," she said, "I have no Christmas experience worth
recounting. Ever since I can remember, Christmas Day has been for me at
first a day on which I received a good many keepsakes, and afterwards a
day on which I gave a good many little gifts.</p>

<p>"But well I remember one particular Christmas Day. I don't know that
the remembrance is worth the telling, but I'll tell it all the same,
because I was about seven years old, and went to 'a party.'</p>

<p>"I was much admired, and I in turn admired greatly a dark, thin
boy of about ten, who had recited 'The Burial of Sir John Moore' (so
jolly on a Christmas Day!). This thin boy was always going down to eat
something, and after the recitation he asked me to come down and have
an ice.</p>

<p>"You will, of course, understand that this was a <i>real</i>
party&mdash;a staying-up-late, low-necked dress, and fan sort of party.
When we had eaten the ices he suggested some lobster salad&mdash;which
I thought would be very nice. He went to fetch the salad and left me
dreaming of him and of his beautiful dark hair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>"Suddenly my dream was interrupted.</p>

<p>"A fat boy with stubbly light hair and freckles on his nose stood
grinning at me and asking me to have some lemonade. I didn't want any
lemonade, and told him so. Thereupon he produced a whole bough of
mistletoe from somewhere or another, and without more ado seized me by
my head and kissed me, and kissed me, and kissed me,&mdash;grinning all
the while.</p>

<p>"I was in a rage, and flew at him like a little cat. He fled out
of the room, up the stairs, I after him. I caught him on the landing,
clawed him by the hair, and banged him, and dared him to kiss me
again.</p>

<p>"He cried, the coward, though he was eight or nine years old. Adding
insult to injury, he said, 'He didn't want to,' and I was 'horrid.'</p>

<p>"I thought he was horrid, for my pretty white frock was torn, and
the thin dark boy, the boy I had fallen in love with, said I should not
have spoken with such a cur, and that it 'served me right.'</p>

<p>"My heart was broken for the first time, and that is why I remember,
and always shall, that miserable Christmas Day."</p>

<p>No doubt the impressionable and impulsive little lady has since
delighted in as many joyous Christmas Days as, in year succeeding
year, she has given happiness to the thousands and thousands who have
revelled in, and been made the better for, the display of her genius.
It is to be feared that the greatest of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
our stage artists never realise the amount of good that they do in the
world. If they did they would not only have their reward in applauding
audiences, but their re-reward in the knowledge that they have brought
light, understanding, and lasting pleasure into countless homes.
Through simple and cheerful paths the good Ben Terrys conducted their
youthful daughters into the profession that Mrs. Kendal has humorously
summed up as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>So many, she declares, have wrong impressions of the stage. Some
think they can jump into fame, and that there is no hard work; others
think it is all hard work, and there is no reward. But, of course,
there are many drawbacks, and people who only sit in the front of
the theatre cannot possibly comprehend what it is until they have
been behind the scenes and worked at it from childhood, as she has
done. Every day, people write to her and ask the qualifications of an
actress. Well, she should have the face of a goddess, the strength
of a lion, the figure of a Venus, the voice of a dove, the temper of
an angel, the grace of a swan, the agility of an antelope, and the
skin of a rhinoceros; great imagination, concentration, an exquisite
enunciation, a generous spirit, a loyal disposition, plenty of courage,
a keen sense of humour, a high ideal of morality, a sensitive mind, and
an original treatment of everything. She must be capable of being a
kind sister, a good daughter, and an excellent wife; a judicious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
mother, an encouraging friend, and an enterprising grandmother! These,
according to an undeniable authority, are the only qualities that are
required for the stage!</p>

<p>Mrs. Kendal's dictum reminds me of what her brother, T. W.
Robertson&mdash;one of the best and most popular dramatists of his
age&mdash;who had gone through a perfect torture of disappointment
before the production of "Society" by the Bancrofts made his name
famous and his path easy, caused one of his characters in a later play
from his pen to say&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, I want to write a comedy."</p>

<p>And when the answer came&mdash;"Well, write one; I should think it
is easy enough&mdash;you've only got to be amusing, spirited, bright,
and life-like. That's all!"</p>

<p>"Oh, <em>that's</em> all, is it?" ruefully responded the would-be comedy
writer.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="p4">FIRST APPEARANCES</p>


<p>The first appearances on the stage of Kate and Ellen Terry were
in every respect triumphant, and in theatrical history will always
be held worthy of record. A time-worn adage tells us not to judge by
first appearances, but those experts who discerned the extraordinary
promise of these children in the opportunities afforded them under the
memorable Charles Kean <i>régime</i>, at the Princess's Theatre, proved
themselves to be true dramatic critics.</p>

<p>As to the very first public appearance of the heroine of these pages
there has been much discussion. When any one deserts an avocation to
"take to the stage," as the phrase goes, a first performance is a
milestone on the road of life and is never forgotten. With children
who, coming from a theatrical family, are, as it were, born to the
stage, it is almost a matter of indifference, and is apt to become
nebulous. Mrs. Kendal, for example, once frankly stated that she
remembered little or nothing of her initial professional efforts until
she was reminded of them by some of the mature actors who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
had appeared in the same pieces on those destined to be interesting
occasions.</p>

<p>There was a general feeling that Ellen Terry's first appearance was
as Mamillius, the little son of King Leontes of Sicilia, in Kean's
elaborate revival of "The Winter's Tale," until in the June of 1880
the eminent dramatic critic and stage historian, Mr. Dutton Cook,
contributed an article to the unhappily defunct <cite>Theatre Magazine</cite>, in
which he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Some four-and-twenty years ago, when the Princess's Theatre was
under the direction of the late Charles Kean, there were included
in his company two little girls, who lent valuable support to the
management, and whose young efforts the playgoers of the time watched
with kindly and sympathetic interest. Shakespearean revivals,
prodigiously embellished, were much in vogue; and Shakespeare, it
may be noted by the way, has testified his regard for children by
providing quite a repertory of parts well suited to the means of
juvenile performers. Lady Macduff's son has appeared too seldom on the
scene, perhaps, to be counted; but Fleance, Mamillius, Prince Arthur,
Falstaff's boy, Moth (Don Armado's page), King Edward V., and his
brother, the Duke of York, Puck, and the other fairies of 'A Midsummer
Night's Dream,' and even Ariel&mdash;these are characters specially
designed for infantile players; and these, or the majority of these,
were sustained at the Princess's Theatre, now by Miss Kate, and now by
Miss Ellen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
Terry, who were wont to appear, moreover, in such other plays, serious
or comic, poetic or pantomimic, as needed the presence and assistance
of the pretty, sprightly, clever children. Out of Shakespeare,
opportunities for Miss Kate Terry were found in the melodramas of 'The
Courier of Lyons' (Sir Henry Irving's 'The Lyons Mail' of to-day),
'Faust and Marguerite,' and the comedy of 'Every One has his Fault.'
The sisters figured together as the Princes murdered in the Tower,
by Mr. Charles Kean as Richard III. What miniature Hamlets they
looked in their bugled black velvet trunks, silken hose, and ostrich
feathers! They were in mourning, of course, for their departed father,
King Edward IV. My recollection of Miss Ellen Terry dates from her
impersonation of the little Duke of York. She was a child of six, or
thereabout, slim and dainty of form, with profuse flaxen curls, and
delicately-featured face, curiously bright and arch of expression; and
she won, as I remember, her first applause when, in clear resonant
tones, she delivered the lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">'Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me;</div>
  <div class="i0">Because that I am little, like an ape,</div>
  <div class="i0">He thinks that you should bear me on his shoulders.'</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Richard's representative meanwhile scowling wickedly and tugging
at his gloves desperately, pursuant to paternal example and stage
tradition. A year or two later and the baby actress was representing
now Mamillius, and now Puck."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, when he arrived at this point, Mr. Dutton Cook raised a
hornet's nest about his ears. In the mind of playgoers it had been
long decided that this all-important first appearance had been in
the character of Mamillius. Where, then, did Mr. Dutton Cook's
picturesquely described Duke of York come in? Mr. George Tawse, who
modestly described himself as a "play-bill-worm," took great interest
in the matter, and having carefully consulted the happily preserved
documents in the British Museum, wrote many letters on the subject to
Mr. Clement Scott, who was then the erudite editor of <i>The Theatre</i>.
These communications attracting some notice (Mr. Tawse, be it noted,
being all in favour of Mamillius), Mr. Scott appealed to headquarters,
and Ellen Terry characteristically wrote to him:&mdash;"The very
first time I ever appeared on any stage was on the first night of
'The Winter's Tale,' at the Princess's Theatre, with dear Charles
Kean. As for the young Princes, them unfortunate little men, I never
played&mdash;not neither of them&mdash;there! What a cry about a little
wool! <em>P.S.</em>&mdash;I was born in Coventry, 1848, and was, I think,
about seven when I played in 'The Winter's Tale.'"</p>

<p>Following up his careful researches, Mr. Tawse ultimately came to
the conclusion that on April 28, 1856, Ellen Terry appeared at the
Princess's as Mamillius in "The Winter's Tale"; on October 15, 1856, as
Puck in "A Midsummer Night's Dream";<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
on December 26, 1857, as the Fairy "Golden Star" in "The White Cat"
pantomime; on April 5, 1858, as Karl in "Faust and Marguerite"; on
October 18, as Prince Arthur in "King John"; on November 17, as Fleance
in "Macbeth"; and on December 28, of the same busy year, as "The Genius
of the Jewels," in the pantomime of "The King of the Castle."</p>

<p>As the lady has so strongly declared for Mamillius, and as Mr. Tawse
thus champions her, I suppose the verdict must be accepted; and yet it
seems very unlikely that such an accurate writer as Mr. Dutton Cook
could have been mistaken concerning that impersonation of the little
Duke of York. Can Ellen Terry have forgotten it? Knowing that she does
not set sufficient value on her work, or the impression it makes on
others, I think it very probable. Indeed, in all due deference to her
and Mr. Tawse (for even play-bills will sometimes unwittingly lie),
I like to give credit to Mr. Dutton Cook's miniature sister Hamlets
in their bugled black velvet trunks, their silken hose, and ostrich
feathers!</p>

<p>As poor little Mamillius, cursed with a jealous yet respected
father, and wondering what the troubles could be that existed between
him and his unhappy, deeply-wronged mother, she must have been very
sweet, and one can fancy what Charles Kean felt when he cried to his
"boy"&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i6">"Come, Sir Page,</div>
  <div class="i0">Look on me with your welkin eye."</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>We have only to realise that in using the word "welkin" Shakespeare
meant "heavenly," to get the expression of the anxious but inspired
little Terry girl.</p>

<p>And if this was indeed her first appearance, her dismissal by
Leontes with the words, "Go play, Mamillius," was almost prophetic.</p>

<p>But if Mr. Dutton Cook chanced to err on the much discussed first
appearance question, he was certainly correct in his critical estimate
of the two remarkable child actresses.</p>

<p>"The public applauded these Terry sisters," he wrote, "not simply
because of their cleverness and prettiness, their graces of aspect, the
careful training they evidenced, and the pains they took to discharge
the histrionic duties entrusted to them, but because of the leaven
of genius discernible in all their performances&mdash;they were born
actresses.</p>

<p>"Children educated to appear becomingly upon the scene have always
been obtainable, and upon easy terms; but here were little players who
could not merely repeat accurately the words they had learnt by rote,
but could impart sentiment to their speeches, could identify themselves
with the characters they played, could personate and portray, could
weep themselves that they might surely make others weep, could sway
the emotions of crowded audiences. They possessed in full that power
of abandonment to scenic excitement which is rare even among the most
consummate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
of mature performers. They were carried away by the force of their
own acting; there were tears not only in their voices but in their
eyes; their mobile faces were quick to reflect the significance of the
drama's events; they could listen, their looks the while annotating,
as it were, the discourse they heard; singular animation and alertness
distinguished all their movements, attitudes, and gestures. There was
special pathos in the involuntary trembling of their baby fingers,
and the unconscious wringing of their tiny hands; their voices were
particularly endowed with musically thrilling qualities. I have never
seen audiences so agitated and distressed, even to the point of
anguish, as were the patrons of the Princess's Theatre on those bygone
nights when little Prince Arthur, personated by either of the Terry
sisters, clung to Hubert's knees as the heated iron cooled in his
hands, pleading passionately for sight, touchingly eloquent of voice
and action; a childish simplicity attendant ever upon all the frenzy,
the terror, the vehemence, and the despair of the speeches and the
situation.</p>

<p>"Assuredly Nature had been very kind to the young actresses, and
without certain natural graces, gifts, and qualifications, there can
scarcely be satisfactory acting. All Romeo's passion may pervade
you, but unless you can look like Romeo&mdash;or something like
him&mdash;if your voice be weak or cracked, your mouth awry or your
legs askew&mdash;it is vain to feel like him;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
you will not convince your audience of your sincerity, or induce them
to sympathise in the least with your actions or sufferings; still less
will you stir them to transports. Of course Genius makes laws unto
itself, and there have been actors who have triumphed over very serious
obstacles; but, as Mr. G. H. Lewes has observed, 'a harsh, inflexible
voice, a rigid or heavy face, would prevent even a Shakespeare from
being impressive and affecting on the stage.' The player is greatly
dependent upon his personality. At the same time, mental qualities must
accompany physical advantages. The constitutionally cold and torpid
cannot hope to represent successfully excitement or passion. The actor
must be <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en rapport</i> with the character he sustains, must sympathise
with the emotions he depicts. A peculiar dramatic sensitiveness and
susceptibility from the first characterised the sisters Terry; their
nervous organisation, their mental impressibility and vivaciousness,
not less than their personal charms and attractions, may be said to
have ordained and determined their success upon the stage."</p>

<p>Coming from this high source such trustworthy and carefully analysed
appreciation is invaluable; but the criticism that I love best to
preserve in connection with the early appearances of the little Terrys
at the Princess's Theatre is that of John William Cole, the biographer
of Charles Kean. Writing for a book (published in 1859), long before
the girls had established their names, he said:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>"Before quitting the subject of 'King John' (1852) at the Princess's
Theatre, it would be unjust not to name in a special sentence of
approval the impressive acting of Miss Kate Terry, then a child of ten
years of age, as Prince Arthur, and of Mr. Ryder as Hubert."</p>

<p>In the revival of "King John" in 1858, Ellen Terry was the Prince
Arthur, that sound actor, John Ryder (he had been one of the mainstays
of Macready), again playing Hubert.</p>

<p>Concerning the production of "A Midsummer Night's Dream" in 1856,
Mr. Cole says: "Another remarkable evidence of the excellent training
of the Princess's Theatre presented itself in the precocious talent of
Miss Ellen Terry, a child of eight years of age, who played the merry
goblin Puck, a part that requires an old head on young shoulders,
with restless elfish animation, and an evident enjoyment of her own
mischievous pranks."</p>

<p>It is because Mr. Cole wrote and published, as it were, "upon the
spot," that I consider his criticism not only discerning, but beyond
all price. We all know how easy it is to prophesy after the event!</p>

<p>Ellen Terry's recollections of her appearance as the infant
Mamillius in "The Winter's Tale" are very vivid, as, indeed, they may
be. In more ways than one it was a notable first night for the little
maid. Queen Victoria, Prince Albert, and the Princess Royal were
present, and the next morning she woke to find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
herself with her foot on the first step of the steep stairs that lead
to fame. No less an authority than the <i>Times</i> declared that she had
played her part with a vivacious precocity that proved her a worthy
relation of her sister. No doubt there were that day rejoicings in the
Terry family, and the sensitive child must have been rewarded for her
own passing tribulations. "My young heart swelled with pride&mdash;I
can recall the sensation now," she has declared, "when I was told what
I had to do,"&mdash;and then comes the sad confession that she wept
bitter and prolonged tears when the audience laughed when she fell over
the rather ridiculous toy-cart with which Mamillius was ordered to
"go play." She calls it her "first dramatic failure," and felt at the
moment that her "career as an actress was ruined for ever."</p>

<p>I wonder if that untoward episode of the toy-cart had anything to
do with the extreme nervousness that, according to her own confession,
the actress always suffers from on "first nights"? Probably not; for I
believe all true stage artists are continually nervous&mdash;nervous
for themselves, nervous for their audiences. She says to this day that
she is so "high strung" on a first night that if she realised that
there was an audience in front staring at her, she would fly away from
the theatre and be far off "in two-twos."</p>

<p>Yes, I fear that all of them, or, at all events, the best of them,
undergo the enduring agonies of nervousness. Once Sothern and Toole
were dining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
with me in Birmingham. In the evening the one had to play Lord
Dundreary at the Theatre Royal, and the other Caleb Plummer at the
Prince of Wales Theatre. They had acted these parts for many, many
hundreds of times, and I had imagined that their approaching work would
be mere pastime to them. But Sothern, speaking to his brother comedian,
said, "I don't know how you feel, John, but I'm as nervous to-night as
I was on my first appearance on the stage."</p>

<p>To my amazement, Toole, who always seemed so at home with his
audiences as to become one amongst them, confessed that he had the same
feeling; and they agreed in saying that when an aspiring young actor
conceitedly set forth as one of his qualifications for the profession
the fact that "he did not know what nervousness meant," he was certain
to do no good. "If you are not always anxious about your work," said
Sothern, "always painfully desirous to be doing your best, you will
soon lose whatever hold you may have on the public." And so said every
one's friend&mdash;the genial John Toole.</p>

<p>Surely this applies to other pursuits besides the art of acting?</p>

<p>Ellen Terry has happier recollections of Puck than of Mamillius, and
no wonder, for the part, although trying, is a delightful one. During
the two hundred and fifty nights of the performance of "A Midsummer
Night's Dream" at the Princess's (a marvellous run<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
for those days) she "revelled in the impish unreason of 'the sprite,'"
and since then she has ever felt the charm of parts "where imagination
can have free play, and there is no occasion to observe too closely the
cold, hard rules of conventionality, and the fetters of dry-as-dust
realism."</p>

<p>Of her performances in the pantomimes, with which, at Christmas
time, Charles Kean found it necessary to supplement his elaborate
productions, we can only imagine (and that is easily done) that she was
a very fascinating little fairy; and it seems equally certain that when
she was called upon to appear in two lengthy entertainments on the same
night, she must often have been a very tired little fairy.</p>

<p>Concerning her representation of Prince Arthur in "King John," a
pathetic little story is extant. At the point where she left the stage
in the full and terrible knowledge that her eyes were to be burnt
out, she at first (presumably at rehearsal) made her exit with such
composure that she received a strong reprimand from Mrs. Kean, who told
her that she must give expression to the anguish of the situation. This
little scolding caused the easily affected child to shed such earnest
tears that her monitress cried out, "Oh, if you can only do that on the
stage, what a Prince Arthur you will be!" The hint was taken to heart
and adopted, and the success of the impersonation was assured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>The new Prince Arthur was honoured with a special call, and the
critics were loud and unanimous in their praises, freely acknowledging
the dramatic force of the performance, together with its delightful
simplicity, tenderness, and truth to nature.</p>

<p>No doubt her position in the theatre compelled Mrs. Kean to be
from time to time an apparently harsh task-mistress, but little Ellen
learnt to love her, and has always remembered with generously expressed
gratitude the benefit she derived from her suggestions and lessons.
But in spite of the hard work and childish troubles that she must
have undergone, she speaks brightly of every one she met in that very
early engagement at the Princess's. In his old age and infirmities she
sympathetically recalls Harley, the eminent comedian for whom Charles
Dickens was induced to write some of those ephemeral farces that in
earlier days had fitfully flourished at the St. James's Theatre; she
remembers affectionately her earnest but exacting dancing-master, Mr.
Oscar Byrn, and the tiring hours that she spent under his determined
rule; she conjures up with pride her first and only meeting with
Macready, and how, when she apologised for accidentally jostling him
while running to her dressing-room, he smiled, laughed, and then said,
"Never mind, you are a very polite little girl, and you act very
earnestly and speak very nicely;" and she is warm in the praises of
Charles Kean, and lastingly appreciative of the strong impression made
upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
her by his vivid personality. But I fancy that the sunny nature of
Ellen Terry has found good in everything, and, throughout her stage
career, has shed brightness and warmth on the somewhat dingy world
behind the scenes.</p>

<p>My friend, Geneviève Ward, who has taken part with her in several
of her memorable Lyceum triumphs, tells me that it is delightful to
bear witness to her sweet disposition&mdash;a cultivated charm that
prompts her to be generous, thoughtful, kind, and considerate to every
one, and to make her genuinely anxious that the humblest actresses
in the company, as well as the principals, should appear to the best
advantage. Thus lovingly thinking of others, Ellen Terry makes herself
loved, and by her radiant presence lightens many a weary heart.</p>

<p>In her own gossamer-like and gem-bespangled "Stray Memories," she
has written: "Why is it, I wonder, that pain is so deeply felt at the
time, and that its memory fades so quickly, while joy flits by almost
unperceived, and yet leaves such deep traces behind? At least, this is
my experience. It may not be so with most people. They may, perhaps,
suffer deeply and remember lightly; enjoy strongly and forget quickly.
If so, I pity them with all my heart. When I sit down to write it is
not the sad recollections that come crowding before me; it is the
bright joyous moments which shape themselves most distinctly in my
mind. 'Oh, what a light, frivolous nature you must have, then!' I hear
some grave and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
reverend signior remark, if any such person ever deigns to read this
flimsy chatter. Well, I am ready to plead guilty to the charge. I was
made like that, and so Nature is to blame, and not I."</p>

<p>Ours would be a gayer and happier world if Nature had cast more of
us in the same mould.</p>

<p>Another Princess's experience was her appearance as a diminutive
"Tiger" page-boy in a farce by Edmund Yates, entitled "If the Cap
Fits," and she confesses to the infinite pride she took in her pair of
miniature and rather tight-fitting top-boots. Here again, though in a
different way to her Shakespearean representations, genuine success was
secured. In his interesting volumes of "Reminiscences" Edmund Yates
records the production, saying, that "'If the Cap Fits' was admirably
acted by, amongst others, Mr. Frank Mathews, Mr. Walter Lacy, and Miss
Ellen Terry ... who played a juvenile groom, a 'tiger,' with great
spirit and vivacity." And, much later on, he says: "In the present
days of genuine heroine-worship, with recollections full upon us of
Beatrice, Viola, Olivia, and Camma, it seems odd to read, in connection
with this slight comedietta, that Miss Ellen Terry is worthy of praise
for the spirit and point with which she played the part of a youthful
groom."</p>

<p>Evidently she believed in the same doctrine as, in his early days,
Colley Cibber did. Weary of being told that the parts he wanted to
attempt were "not in his way," he protested: "I think anything, naturally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
written, ought to be in everybody's way that pretends to be an
actor."</p>

<p>Ellen Terry could not agree with those critics who declared
that Charles Kean went too far in the mounting of his plays. The
theatre-goers of those days had not been taught to expect beautiful
and correct scenery, and exact accuracy in costume; and some of them
actually resented it, leaning to the view held by Kean's contemporary
and friend, Dr. Westland Marston, who considered that in some of the
spectacular revivals at the Princess's, unnecessary pageantry was not
only introduced but absolutely obtruded. For example, he said that
in the beautiful production of Richard II. a display of too minute
correctness in armorial bearings, weapons and household vessels made
the stage an auxiliary to the museum, and forced it to combine lessons
on archæology with the display of character and passion.</p>

<p>Such were the thanks that Charles Kean received for his
indefatigable and scholarly research, and lavish expenditure! How he
would have loved to hear his little Mamillius and winsome Puck declare
in the days of her fame, and when hers had become a voice in the land
greater than his own, that with rare perception he had opened his eyes
to the absurd anachronisms in costume and accessories which prevailed
at that period, and that he established a system which has been
perfected by Sir Henry Irving and his contemporaries. To have been a
pioneer in good work eventually means fame, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
pioneers are apt to be distrusted by those who have not the courage to
accompany them on their explorations.</p>

<p>She also draws an apt comparison between the remuneration and work
of the actors of the Charles Kean days and now.</p>

<p>"Very young actors," she says (I again venture to quote from her
"Stray Memories"), "sometimes complain of low salaries and long hours.
I wish they could see Mr. Kean's salary-list&mdash;they would soon
cease to grumble. Why, a young man to-day gets as much for carrying
on a coal-box as an experienced actor then received for playing an
important part. Then, how different the hours are! If a company now has
to rehearse for four hours in the day it is thought a great hardship.
But when I was a child rehearsals often used to last until four or five
in the morning. What weary work it was to be sure! My poor little legs
used to ache, and sometimes I could hardly keep my eyes open when I was
on the stage. Often I used to creep into the green-room, which every
one acquainted with the old Princess's will remember well; and there,
curled up in the deep recess of the window, forget myself, my troubles,
and my art&mdash;if you can talk of art in connection with a child of
eight&mdash;in a delicious sleep."</p>

<p>It is a pathetic little portrait, but the hard work,
the early training and the weary hours resulted in
well won, nay almost unique success, and an artistic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
career that has rejoiced the hearts of her fellow creatures, and will
for ever live in the history of the stage.</p>

<p>Charles Kean's memorable management of the Princess's Theatre came
to an end in 1859, and with it terminated the engagement of the Terry
family.</p>

<p>In thinking of Charles Kean I always conjure up three pictures.</p>

<p>The first one represents the dingy lodging in the now demolished
Cecil Street, Strand, where his father, Edmund Kean, is staying with
his devoted wife and three-year-old boy. The struggling strolling
player has got his chance at last. He is to appear to-night as Shylock
at Drury Lane. It is the night of January 14, 1814, and in theatrical
lore is for ever memorable. "I must dine to-day," the nervous actor
said&mdash;and for the first time in many days he indulged in the
luxury of meat. "My God!" he exclaimed to his wife, "if I succeed I
shall go mad!" As the church clocks were striking six he sallied forth
from his meagre apartment with the parting words: "I wish I was going
to be shot." In his hand he carried a small bundle&mdash;containing
shoes, stockings, wig, and other trifles of costume, and so he trudged
through the cold and foggy streets, and the thick slush of thawing snow
that penetrated his worn boots and chilled him to the bone. And then
the exultant return home after the curtain had fallen upon the wild
enthusiasm of an electrified audience! Nearly mad with delight, and
with half-frenzied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
incoherency he poured forth the story of his triumph. "Mary!" he cried
to his wife, "you shall ride in your carriage yet! Charles," lifting
the boy from his bed, "shall go to Eton!"</p>

<p>Then followed his career of unexampled success and prosperity
continually marred and at last ruined by the dissipated habits to
which this giant among tragic actors allowed himself to become the
unhappy victim&mdash;habits that wrecked his home and well-nigh ruined
his reputation. Between 1814 and 1827 his earnings had amounted to
£200,000, and yet when he died in 1833 everything he left behind him,
all his presents and mementos, had to be sent to the hammer to pay his
debts.</p>

<p>The 25th March 1833 (here is my second picture) saw the end of his
stage career. For the first and only time Edmund the father and Charles
the son (who had been sent to Eton, but who had taken to the stage as
most of the sons of true actors will) stood upon the London boards
together, the one playing Othello, the other Iago.</p>

<p>The event caused great excitement among playgoers, and the house was
crammed to suffocation. But Edmund Kean went through his part "dying
as he went," until he came to the "Farewell,"&mdash;and the strangely
appropriate words&mdash;"Othello's occupation's gone."</p>

<p>Then he gasped for breath, and, falling upon his son's shoulder, moaned,
"I am dying, speak to them for me." Within a few months the restless spirit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Edmund Kean was at peace in the quiet churchyard at Richmond.</p>

<p>The third picture has been limned by Dr. Westland Marston, and shows
a sad little episode in the declining years of Charles Kean, a man
who, devoid of the genius of his erring father, had ever attempted to
promote the highest interests of his calling, and to do good in the
world.</p>

<p>"In the autumn of 1866," says my vivid word painter, "I chanced to
be at Scarborough. The evening before leaving, when passing by one of
the hotels&mdash;I think the Prince of Wales's&mdash;there appeared,
framed in one of the windows, a worn, pallid face, with a look of
deep melancholy abstraction. 'Charles Kean!' I exclaimed to myself,
and prepared to retrace my way and call. But, having heard already
that he had been seriously unwell while playing a round of provincial
engagements, I thought it better not to disturb him or to bring home to
him a grave impression as to his health, even by a card of enquiry. In
little more than a year after this his death took place. It occurred
in January 1868, when he had reached his fifty-seventh year.... His
friends who are still amongst us will cherish the recollection of
a high-principled gentleman, warm in his attachments, generous in
extending to others the appreciation he coveted for himself, and
gifted with a charm of simple candour that made even his weaknesses
endearing."</p>

</div>

<p>It is to be feared that in the theatrical career on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
which he started with so much energy and confidence Charles Kean met
with lack of appreciation and much disappointment.</p>

<p>I wonder what would have been the effect if the consoling words of
George William Curtis (one of the most beautiful of American writers)
had been wafted to him across the Atlantic?</p>

<p>"Success," says Curtis, "is a delusion. It is an
attainment&mdash;but who attains? It is the horizon, always bounding
our path and therefore never gained. The Pope, triple-crowned, and
borne with flabella through St. Peter's, is not successful&mdash;for he
might be canonised into a saint. Pygmalion, before his perfect statue,
is not successful,&mdash;for it might live. Raphael, finishing the
Sistine Madonna, is not successful,&mdash;for her beauty has revealed
to him a finer and an unattainable beauty."</p>

<p>To the true artist such truths as these strike home, and I fear
they often throw their cloud over the apparently ever sunny-minded
Ellen Terry. It is a fact that she often feels she has failed where
enthusiastic audiences, and even the most captious critics, testify to
the fact that she has triumphed. But she knows that any seeming victory
in human life is not final achievement, but a spur (often a cruel one)
to endless endeavour. The artistic temperament must be more or less
self-tormenting, and those who desire mere personal comfort should
never attempt to cultivate it. Devoid of it they can smugly criticise,
and with intense self-satisfaction condemn, the life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
work of those who well nigh exhaust their energies in order to provide
them with entertainment.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the Princess's engagement Mr. Ben Terry seems
to have been inspired by a happy thought. Probably he knew that in 1859
there were thousands of goody-goody people who did not like to be seen
in a real theatre, but who would flock to see theatricals under the
guise of "A Drawing-Room Entertainment." Possibly he was aware that
the congregations of goody-goodies, who still had an idea that Mawworm
was right when he declared that the playhouse was the devil's hot-bed,
took an eager interest in reading anything that appeared concerning the
stage. The youthful fame of Kate and Ellen Terry was well established.
Their stars were in the ascendant, everybody (including the useful army
of goody-goodies) wanted to see them;&mdash;why not let them appear in
a "Drawing-Room Entertainment"?</p>

<p>Perhaps I am wrong in hinting at such things as these in
connection with the business arrangements of Mr. Ben Terry. Anyway, a
"Drawing-Room Entertainment" was devised for the attractive sisters,
and it became exceedingly popular.</p>

<p>It was first brought out at the Royal Colosseum, Regent's Park,
in those days a favourite place for amusements of this description.
It proved so attractive that it ran for thirty consecutive nights,
during which more than thirty thousand people paid for admission, and
expressed their delight in the entertainment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
Thus encouraged, it was taken on tour to the leading as well as the
smaller provincial towns.</p>

<p>Those who, like myself, remember the Colosseum as it used to be, and
were in their juvenile days taken there as to one of the "Sights of
London," will remember the weird, imitation stalactite caverns. Ellen
Terry has confessed that it was amid the artificial gloom of these
shams that she first studied Juliet. At least they served one good
purpose! By the courtesy of Mr. Percy Fitzgerald I am able to give the
following copy of the Terry programme.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>The second item on the modest little play-bill appears to have
been the strong attraction. In this Kate Terry played the part of a
charming young lady who is discovered eagerly expecting her younger
brother's arrival home for his first holidays. She pictures to herself
the innocent, tender-hearted, shy little fellow who only a few months
ago was sent away "unwillingly to school," and she longs to kiss
him, and once more pour out upon him her sweet sisterly sympathy.
But to her astonishment, when Harry&mdash;(impersonated by Ellen
Terry)&mdash;appears, she finds that in a very short period he has
degenerated, and acquired the habits of a precocious, over-dressed,
cigar-smoking, horsey little cad. After some amusing scenes, in which
the shocked sister endeavours to appeal to the better senses of the
irrepressible little monkey, she goes out, and returning disguised as
a determined old gentlewoman, endeavours to replace gentle persuasion
by superior force. In a way she succeeds, and then a cleverly brought
about little episode shows her that beneath the shoddy veneer of
her brother's silly would-be-manly habits his true heart beats and
yearns towards her; and so they kiss and are friends again, and at
curtain-fall the audience know that both for sister and brother the
holidays will be happy ones.</p>

<p>Kate Terry was admirable both as the dismayed girl and the elderly
lady, and Ellen Terry caused abundant amusement as the impish
schoolboy. "Distant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Relations" was also a clever little sketch, and the entertainment was
at once merry and interesting.</p>

<p>Ellen Terry speaks with fond recollection of that little touring
party of five, the odd number being made up by Mr. Sydney Naylor,
who, in the capacity of pianist (he subsequently made for himself a
well-known name), accompanied the father and mother and their two young
daughters. For more than two years they gaily travelled from town to
town, supremely happy in each other's society, always drawing large
and appreciative audiences, and having every reason to be satisfied
with the financial results of their experiment. No doubt it was a "good
time," and probably all concerned in it were sorry when it came to an
end; but even two years make a great difference in young ladies of
tender age&mdash;all entertainments run their course&mdash;and more
serious work had to be approached.</p>

<p>London was naturally their goal, and Ellen Terry soon found an
engagement at the Royalty Theatre. The little Soho playhouse&mdash;the
scene of varying fortunes and many strange theatrical
experiments&mdash;had just passed into the hands of a Madame Albina de
Rhona, an attractive Parisian actress and <i>danseuse</i>. Having made her
name in Paris and St. Petersburg, this ambitious lady had resolved to
captivate London, and, as her appearances at the St. James's and Drury
Lane Theatres had met with encouragement, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
boldly resolved to try her luck as an English manageress. One of her
first attractions at the Royalty (by the way, it was originally called
the Royal Soho Theatre, and Madame de Rhona is credited with having
given it its new and brighter name) was an adaptation of Eugene Sue's
romance, "Atar-Gull."</p>

<p>On the stage it was the grimmest and wildest of productions, and
of all the strange pranks played on the boards of the Royalty, this
must surely have been the strangest. It set forth a ghastly story
of a negro who (the scene was laid in Jamaica), in order to avenge
the death of his father, made it his life's business to murder every
member of his master's family. The piece was replete with horrors and
wholly unsuited to the little bandbox of a house, which, in later
years, when the Broughs, Burnand, and other humorous writers were at
their brightest, and when burlesque was true burlesque&mdash;witty,
coherent, and cohesive, we associated with all that is exhilarating and
mirth-provoking. Those who, with me, can conjure up the days of the
"Patty" Oliver <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">régime</i> will know what I mean.</p>

<p>But all I have to do with the gruesome "Atar-Gull" is to make brief
note of the part in it that Ellen Terry was called upon to play. It was
that of a fair young girl named Clementine who (not unnaturally) has an
aversion to the snakes that infest her environment. In order to cure
her of this reprehensible prejudice, it occurs to some idiot (possibly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
an interfering aunt) to order a dead snake to be put in her room.
This is an opportunity for the revengeful negro, and he contrives
to give her a live and deadly reptile for her companion. With the
living venomous creature coiled about her neck and body, and ever
tightening its scaly, slimy hug, the terrified girl appears screaming
on the stage. Into this horrible situation, and the opportunity it
afforded her, the still childish Ellen Terry put her whole heart,
and outscreamed all actresses, whether young or old. It was not
one prolonged scream and then collapse. As her terror and agony
seemed to increase, shriek succeeded shriek&mdash;a shriek for
deliverance&mdash;a shriek of bodily anguish&mdash;and a shriek of
hopeless despair. No doubt the effect was startling, and unquestionably
it thrilled her audiences. It was all wonderfully done, and the fear
of the wretched girl was depicted with almost painful fidelity. But
the ridiculous, misplaced, and sensational play made the situation an
absurd one.</p>

<p>If it were repeated to-day we should think of the nonsense
rhyme&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"There was a young lady of Russia,</div>
  <div class="i0">Who screamed so, that no one could hush her."</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As it was, it made many people laugh; but on the critics, who could
"read between the lines," it left its impression, and gave hope of
wondrous things to come. Happily, most of them lived to see them come.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
It was all a question of training. According to Ellen Terry's own
account, Madame Albina de Rhona must have been a very difficult lady
to work under, and yet her warm heart prompts her to speak to-day in
affectionate terms of her second manageress. In the case of this gifted
child the quality of mercy was never strained. Her tasks had to be
endured, but she schooled herself to enjoy them, and she tried to love
those with whom she worked.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="p4">THE BRISTOL STOCK COMPANY</p>


<p>The engagement at the Royalty was only a stopgap, and at its
termination the wise Mr. Ben Terry took his daughter "to school," in
one of the famous stock companies that then most happily existed in all
the large provincial towns. They were indeed "schools"&mdash;schools of
a very practical order&mdash;and in them most of the leading actors of
our generation graduated.</p>

<p>Now that they have vanished, the great question among the would-be
actors and actresses of to-day (or I should say among those who are in
earnest) is "where can we find a true dramatic school?" Alas! too many
of them abjure school, and, with the awkwardness (though very little of
the timidity) of half-fledged birds, flutter blindly on to the stage,
and blunder under the unwonted glare of footlights, to the bewilderment
of the theatrical <i>habitués</i> and the despair of critics, but apparently
to the great satisfaction of themselves and their foolishly admiring
friends.</p>

<p>I am inclined to think that theatre-lovers who never lived in a
large town in the good old stock company days missed one of the joys of
life. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
actors and actresses in those companies (I speak from personal
experience) were our pride and our delight. Their names were familiar
in our mouths and homes as household words. Eagerly we scanned the
ever-changing play-bills to see what this or that favourite would do
next; anxiously we turned to the newspaper to see if the privileged
critic did full justice to them. They were, both on and off the stage,
our local heroes, heroines, soul-inspirers, and mirth-provokers. They
were familiar figures in our streets, and we loved to meet them.
When, according to the custom of those days, the "stars" from London
came down to be supported by the stock company, we were so loyal to
the friends who delighted us all the year round that we pretended to
think little or nothing of the stars. When, in due course, some of
them moved on to London, we watched their careers with the deepest
interest. In short, between the players and their patrons there
existed a personal affection. If they did not know each other "off the
stage," the magnetic touch was there, and it meant everything to those
on both sides of the curtain. The result was painstaking and sound
(if not always great) acting, and well-judged applause from fond and
encouraging audiences. Under such conditions, actors who already had
their hearts in their vocation, did not care how hard they worked, and
constant experience, coupled with true endeavour, perfected them in
their art.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>But it <i>was</i> hard work! Edward Compton has told me that at the
shortest notice he was called upon to study and play within one week
important parts in "The Octoroon," "The Old Toll House," "Thirty Years
of a Gambler's Life," and "Raby Rattler," and I believe Sir Henry
Irving could record even harder experiences.</p>

<p>But the firing of the clay brought out the colours on the porcelain,
and the colours lasted. At the time when Ellen Terry was taken to
one of these important schools, there was no better stock company in
England than that brought together by Mr. J. H. Chute, the enterprising
and far-seeing manager of the Theatre Royal, Bristol. Mr. Chute seemed
to have a knack of gathering about him most of the promising young
artists of the day, and certainly those who learnt their lessons under
the roof of his academy did justice to his name.</p>

<p>It is tantalising to think of a West of England stock company (Mr.
Chute at that time was responsible for the Bath as well as the Bristol
theatre) that, within a very short period, could boast of such a
constellation of names as Madge Robertson (Mrs. Kendal), Marie Wilton
(Lady Bancroft), Henrietta Hodson (Mrs. Labouchere), Kate Bishop, Kate
and Ellen Terry, George Melville, Arthur Stirling, George and William
Rignold, W. H. Vernon, David James, Charles Coghlan, Arthur Wood, John
Rouse, and J. F. Cathcart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>No wonder that in such a school, and with such
schoolmates, Ellen Terry learnt very useful lessons.
There was an abundance of work. One-act farces and
genuine burlesques were then in vogue, and these, with
tragedy or comedy, formed the day's rehearsal and
the evening's bill. Every one took part in them, and
both for brains and body it was sharp and onerous
work. But they were enthusiasts; they were aware
of their local popularity; they were ready to tackle
anything that came in their way, and so their names
were made.</p>

<p>For example, Ellen Terry was cast for a part in
a burlesque. She told the stage manager that she
could neither sing nor dance. The reply was laconic
and decisive: "<em>You've got to do it!</em>" "And I did, in
a way," she says; "but it was the best thing that
could happen to me, for it took the self-consciousness
out of me&mdash;and, after a while, I thought it was capital
fun, for the Bath and Bristol people were very kind."</p>

<p>But it was not all burlesque. Relief to clever
William Brough's "Endymion"&mdash;"Perseus and Andromeda;
or the Maid and the Monster," and so forth,
was found in serious drama, and sometimes in Shakespeare.
Kate Terry had preceded her younger sister
to Bristol, and speedily established herself as a
favourite. Her Portia and Beatrice were already
popular performances, and renewed zest was added to
them when "Pretty Miss Ellen" was at hand to play
Nerissa and Hero.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>During this useful engagement Ellen Terry formed
an intense admiration for some of her co-mates. She
fell in love with the beautiful singing voice of Madge
Robertson (it was an open question then whether our
Mrs. Kendal of to-day would devote herself to opera
or drama), and she is especially warm in her praises
of the finished acting of Charles Coghlan. How some
of these budding artists crossed each other's paths in
later and famous days we shall see in the course of
these pages.</p>

<p>From an old friend, who in the days of his youth
aspired to be an actor, but, after a short trial, quitted
the stage to make his name as journalist and author,
I have received the following interesting notes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You ask me, my dear Pemberton," he writes, "to
give you my recollections of Ellen Terry in those now,
alas! far-off days of my youth, when I was for a brief
time connected in a very humble capacity with the
Theatre Royal, Bristol. It was in the early sixties
(1862, I think) that Ellen and her elder sister, Kate
(now Mrs. Arthur Lewis), were engaged by the late
James Henry Chute as members of his stock company,
Kate playing the juvenile lead and the principal
ladies in the classical burlesques, which were then the
vogue and quite as attractive as the legitimate drama.
The company also included Miss Henrietta Hodson
(now Mrs. Labouchere), soubrette and principal boy,
the late Charles Coghlan, light comedian, William and
George Rignold, John Rouse, Mr. and Mrs. Robertson,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
and their daughter Madge, the latter only in her early
'teens, and Arthur Wood, 'first low comedian.'</p>

<p>"Ellen Terry was then a girl of about fourteen,
of tall figure, with a round, dimpled, laughing, mischievous
face, a pair of merry, saucy grey eyes, and
an aureole of golden hair, which she wore, in the
words of a modern ditty, 'hanging down her back.'
Although dwarfed, in a measure, as an actress, by the
more experienced skill and the superior <i>rôles</i> of her
fascinating sister, Ellen soon became a great favourite
in Bristol. Her popularity was largely due to her
performances in two of the Brough brothers' burlesques&mdash;'Endymion'
and 'Perseus and Andromeda.' In the
former Miss Hodson played Endymion, Kate Terry
was Diana, and Ellen, Cupid, and a very arch, piquant
sprite, full of movement and laughter, Miss Ellen
was.</p>

<p>"She wore a loose short-skirted sort of tunic with
a pair of miniature wings, and of course carried the
conventional bow and quiver. Some of the more
prudish of the Bristol theatre-goers&mdash;the same people
who had been wont to roar over the vulgar comicalities
of Johnny Rouse&mdash;were half inclined to be
shocked at a scantiness of attire that even Mr. Chute
himself was disposed to think (<em>i.e.</em> for the modest
early sixties: to-day a Cupid <em>with a</em> '<em>skirted</em> tunic'
would be considered sadly over-dressed) a 'little
daring.'</p>

<p>"But Ellen Terry's charm, her delightful grace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
and innate refinement, quite disarmed the prudes,
and Cupid triumphed in front of the curtain as well
as behind it, and lightly shot his darts in all directions.
Miss Hodson was at that time a deservedly
great favourite, but the Terry sisters unconsciously
became the founders of a new cult among local playgoers,
and set up an empire of their own; in fact, I
am hardly exaggerating if I say that there were
among the gilded youth of Bristol two rival factions&mdash;the
Hodson faction and the Terry faction,
whose friendly antagonism was as keen, if not as
fatal, as that of the Montagues and the Capulets.</p>

<p>"If my memory serves me right, Ellen was the
Dictys of the other burlesque, Miss Hodson and Miss
Kate Terry playing the two <em>rôles</em> of the title. In
one of these pieces Arthur Wood had to speak a line
in which occurs the phrase, "such a mystery here."
He made much nightly capital&mdash;for these burlesques
had long runs considering they were played by a
stock company in a provincial theatre&mdash;by emphasising
the syllables of 'mystery,' so as to make the
sentence sound 'such a Miss Terry here.'</p>

<p>"I was only a general utility actor in that company,
and I had to play one of the crowd in 'Perseus
and Andromeda,' whose duty it was to be suddenly
turned to stone, after the fashion of Lot's wife&mdash;only
with a more studied artistic pose&mdash;at the sight of
Medusa's head. In order to give <em>vraisemblance</em> to
the illusion, we of the populace were costumed in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
parti-coloured fashion, one half white, the other half
of some strong colour, and our faces were made up
on one side only with a sort of whitewash. When,
at the given signal, we turned round our white sides
with the precision of soldiers at drill to the full
stream of the limelight, striking simultaneously
more or less statuesque attitudes, the situation was,
for those days, effective, and nightly brought down
the house and evoked a call for the manager. I
recollect that before the production, in order to
ascertain the effect of the whitewash, one or two of
us, true to our profession of 'general utility,' had to
put it on at a midnight rehearsal, after we had
resumed our ordinary dress. Many years have
elapsed since the incident, yet I can still hear the
peals of musical laughter with which Ellen Terry
greeted our intensely comical appearance, and I can
still see the mischief and good-natured ridicule
sparkling in her merry eyes.</p>

<p>"If I had to describe her acting in those days, I
should say its chief characteristic was a vivacious
sauciness. Her voice already had some of the rich
sympathetic quality which has since been one of her
most distinctive charms. Although only in the first
flush of a joyous girlhood, she was yet familiar
enough with the stage to be absolutely at home on
it, and in such complete touch with her audiences
that she could afford to discard the serious spirit
altogether, even when the situation demanded a less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
frivolous mood. That she made these little subordinate
parts in the burlesques not only dominate the
stage at the time, but also caused them to live in the
memory all these years, is evidence enough of the
compelling force and infection of her irrepressible
mirthfulness. At rehearsals, even more than when
acting, she was brimful of merriment, taking nothing
gravely;&mdash;a gay, mercurial child, flitting about hither
and thither with ever the same exuberant <em>insouciance</em>,
the same defiant spirit of laughter, as if life and all
its possibilities of tangle and tragedy had only a
holiday meeting for her. As I look back on those
bright and too brief 'salad' days, it seems to me
that Ellen Terry might have been regarded as the
epitome of that 'golden age' in which people 'fleeted
the time carelessly.'</p>

<p>"Mrs. Terry always accompanied her daughters
to and from the theatre every night, and watched
them from the wings during the whole time they
were on the stage. They lodged during the season
in Queen Square, then the recognised quarter for
theatrical folks. The theatre itself was situated in
King Street; I believe it still exists, but its glory,
like that of Ichabod, has long since departed. A
theatre in Park Row has superseded the famous old
house where so many great actors and actresses
were trained; and the whole neighbourhood round
that building, once throbbing with artistic interest,
has become sordid and neglected, and redolent of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
ship chandlery. But in the old times, outside the
little narrow stage-door, crowds of dazzled Lotharios
and stage-struck worshippers used to throng to see
the 'Terrys' go home after the performance. Mrs.
Terry played her part of duenna with uncommon
vigilance, and it was little more than a snap-shot
vision of three hurrying and well-wrapped up figures
that rewarded the admirers for their patience.</p>

<p>"I recollect one poor lad who was an assistant
in a large drapery establishment in Wine Street,
Bristol. He was infatuated with the beautiful Kate
Terry, though he had never spoken to her, and probably
he never even saw her off the stage. But
he left bouquets and other gifts addressed to her at
the stage-door, and as there was nothing to indicate
who the donor was, or where he lived, she could
not send them back. Sometime after this young
fellow was arrested for embezzlement. He had taken
his employer's money, partly in order to gratify a
passion for the theatre, and partly to enable him to
buy presents for the divinity whom he worshipped
from afar. It was a painful little drama of real life;
and I know that no one was more distressed than
Miss Terry herself when she read the account of the
magisterial proceedings in the paper.</p>

<p>"I could tell you a lot about the 'Old Duke'
tavern, the famous theatrical rendezvous of those
days; but the 'Terrys,' of course, did not come on in
that convivial scene. I am reminded, however, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
one of its regular <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">habitués</i> was Charley Adams, the
theatre prompter, about whom many diverting stories
might be told. Whenever there was a stage wait or
anything went wrong, Charley lost his head entirely,
and rushed about with 'language' on his lips and
tears streaming down his cheeks. On one occasion
the stage was kept waiting for George Rignold, the
audience began to be impatient, and Charley was
distracted. Ellen Terry happened to be standing in
the prompt wing, and, rendered desperate by the
growing delay, Charley, with forcible if florid eloquence,
expressed in the true Bristol vernacular,
pushed her on to the stage. 'Go on! go on!' he
screamed, making the objective of his imperative
mood fairly totter with adjectives. Miss Terry was,
however, by no means embarrassed. She quietly
took in the situation: her always welcome presence
elicited a hearty cheer, and by the time she had
crossed the stage and disappeared on the O.P. side,
the missing actor had turned up and proceeded to
'smooth out the creases.'</p>

<p>"Poor old Charley was often a butt for Ellen
Terry's pleasant banter. He was a rather illiterate
man, and made mistakes of speech which were an
irresistible theme of ridicule with this mirthful maiden.
How she laughed when he spoke of the 'Jorgon's'
head, and called the statues 'statties,' and performed
other amazing feats of verbal metamorphosis.</p>

<p>"Charley was always at his best in the 'Old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Duke' smoking-room with his long clay pipe, after his
sixth 'small jug' of eleemosynary beer. Then he
was confidential, impressive, sententious, and 'dear
boy'd' every one with a friendship which was none the
less sincere because its fount was somewhat <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'alchoholic'">alcoholic</ins>.
It is many a year since the earth closed over
thee, thou poor, excitable, and sometimes self-indulgent
disciple of Thespis, but none who knew thee can
ever have any but kindly memories of thy simple
undisguised obsequiousness to the 'star,' and thy
majestically patronising mien to the super.</p>

<p>"I have used the name Ellen Terry throughout
the above notes, but at that time she was always and
to every one, 'Nelly.' She was announced as 'Miss
Nelly Terry' in the play-bills, and I have an old
friendly letter from her, written only a few months
after she left Bristol, in which she signs herself
'Nelly.' The handwriting is angular and 'school-missish,'
with no indication of the soundness and
flexible strength which have since become its characteristics.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I have laid too much stress on the two
burlesque parts which have the deepest roots in my
memory. 'Miss Nelly' played other parts; she was
the 'walking lady' of the company, and I have (rather
hazy) recollections of her in a crinolined dress in that
fine old melodrama 'The Angel of Midnight; or, The
Duel in the Snow'; as a fashionable dame in the
glittering but immoral coterie which forms the personal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
background in 'The Marble Heart'; and as the
<em>ingenue</em> in a once popular comedietta entitled 'The
Little Treasure.'</p>

<p>"To say that she then showed unmistakable
promise of the pre-eminent position to which she has
since attained in English dramatic art would be to
exhibit that 'after-the-event' wisdom which is so
common a feature of modern prophecy. I will only
say that we, the young fellows of that day, thought
she was perfection; we toasted her in our necessarily
frugal measures; we would gladly have been her
hewers of wood and drawers of water. She had
personal charm as well as histrionic skill. Her smiles
were very sweet, but, alack for all of us, they were
mathematically impartial."</p>

<p>These jottings are not only interesting as regards
the early career of Kate and Ellen Terry, but they
prove my views as to the affection in which the
famous old stock companies were held by their devoted
provincial patrons. In these days of ephemeral
touring troupes such a condition of things is impossible,
and really earnest students of the drama starve
for lack of nourishment.</p>

<p>On April 2, 1862, the old Bath Theatre of many
glorious memories was destroyed by fire; but James
Henry Chute was not the man to be dismayed by
disaster. Within a year it was rebuilt, and on
March 4, 1863, was again ready for its faithful
audiences.</p>

<p>Speaking by the light of to-day, this was indeed
a rich cast, and it is interesting to note how Madge
Robertson and Ellen Terry&mdash;destined to become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
the two greatest actresses of their generation&mdash;thus
played together in their "'prentice days." No doubt
the "singing fairy" of the evening inspired Titania
with her admiration for Mrs. Kendal's exquisite voice.</p>

<p>Long after their stock company days, the Terry
Sisters held their well-merited and remarkable
popularity in Bristol. That distinguished actor,
W. H. Vernon, who, as we have seen, graduated as
one of Mr. Chute's "young people," has told me how
enthusiastically they were received when, with London
honours thick upon them, they came to "star" in
their old "school," in a piece called "A Sister's
Penance," which had been a great success at the
Adelphi Theatre. Vernon, who was "Miss Nelly's"
lover on that occasion, was immensely struck by
her merriment and high spirits at the rehearsal in
the morning and (in contrast) her wonderful display
of true emotion in the performance of the evening.</p>

<p>In connection with Ellen Terry's next appearance
in London, it is curious to note that in the famous
Bath programme that preceded it, William Rignold
should figure as "Lord Dundreary"&mdash;the "Spirit of
the Hour"; and that she should be so aptly chosen
for "The Spirit of the Future."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="p4">AT THE HAYMARKET THEATRE</p>


<p>The compiler of the Bath programme was right
when he spoke of Lord Dundreary as the "Spirit
of the Hour." The phenomenal success of the late
E. A. Sothern in this eccentric and most original
character, at the Haymarket Theatre, had taken all
London (nay, all England) by storm. At the time
of which I am writing the name of Dundreary was
upon the lips of every one. Men cultivated Dundreary
whiskers, and affected Dundreary coats,
waistcoats, and trousers; indeed, Sothern had become
such a good friend to the tailors that, if he
would have accepted them, he might have been
furnished, without any mention of payment, with
clothes sufficient for a dozen lifetimes. His dressing-room
at the Haymarket was crowded with parcels
sent by energetic haberdashers, who knew that if
by wearing it upon the stage he would set the
fashion for a certain sort of necktie, or a particular
pattern of shirt-cuff or collar, their fortunes would
be half made; and hatters and boot-makers followed
in the haberdashers' wake. Dundreary photographs
were seen everywhere. "Dundrearyisms," as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
came to be called, were the fashionable <em>mots</em> of the
day; and little books (generally very badly done)
dealing with the imaginary doings of Dundreary
under every possible condition, and in every quarter
of the globe, were in their thousands sold at the
street corners. Concerning Dundreary quite three
parts of England went more than half mad, and
not to know all about him and his deliciously quaint
sayings and doings was to argue yourself unknown.</p>

<p>The actor who not only caused but sustained all
this excitement must have achieved something far
greater than the mere creation of a new type of
"stage swell." Dundreary was a study for the
philosopher as well as a laughing-stock for the idler,
and he thus became popular with all classes of the
community.</p>

<p>But in 1863 Sothern was growing tired of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">toujours</i>
Dundreary. He was a restless as well as an
ambitious actor, and he longed for a change. An
Englishman by birth and training, all his great
successes (including Dundreary) had been won in
America, and he wished to show the Haymarket
audiences what he could do in other characters.
For the time being that fine old actor-manager,
J. B. Buckstone, could not hear of his "Lordship"
being out of the bill, so Sothern had to content
himself with occasional afterpieces.</p>

<p>Among the characters that he fancied was that
of Captain Walter Maydenblush in that pretty little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
adaptation from the French, "La Joie de la Maison,"
entitled "The Little Treasure." It is a very effective
light comedy part, but the mainstay of the
piece is the "joy of the house," the sweet young
girl, Gertrude. When the piece was first produced
at the Haymarket this part had been played by
Blanche Fane, the idol of her day, and it had also
been made familiar to playgoers by the ever-fascinating
Marie Wilton, now Lady Bancroft. Sothern
knew very well that without an attractive Gertrude
his Walter Maydenblush would go for nothing.
Where was she to be found? Well, as we have
seen, Ellen Terry had played the part in Bristol.
Her growing fame had reached London, and she
was engaged to re-create it at the Haymarket.</p>

<p>Although the piece was a subordinate one, her
ordeal was formidable, for she had to challenge comparison
with her popular and gifted predecessors in
a character that required an abundance of delicacy
and finesse.</p>

<p>Her success was instantaneous. In writing of it
that outspoken critic and encyclopædia of dramatic
lore, Edward Leman Blanchard, said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"She is very young, but shows no trace of immaturity
either in her style or figure. Tall for her
age, of prepossessing appearance, and with expressive
features full of vivacity and intelligence, she secured
at once the sympathies of her audience, and retained
them by the joyous spirit and deep feeling with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
which she imbued the personation. In the girlish
playfulness exhibited through the first act Miss
Ellen Terry was especially happy, and in characters
illustrative of a frank and impulsive temperament
the young actress will prove a most desirable addition
to the feminine strength of the stage."</p>

<p>And so it was with all the leading critics, they,
and delighted audiences, telling her that in a moment
her permanent popularity in London was a thing
assured.</p>

<p>Of course she had in due course to support Lord
Dundreary in "Our American Cousin," a play which,
not very good to begin with, had, for the sake of
Sothern's superbly droll performance, been whittled
down to a mere nothing. With the exception of the
characters of Asa Trenchard (and he had been converted
into an absurd caricature of an American) and
Mary Meredith, the one sympathetic woman of the
piece, the other parts were indeed thankless ones, and
it seems impossible to think that Ellen Terry, our
greatest living Shakespearean actress, was once wasted
on the insipid <em>role</em> of Georgina, the affected girl on
whom Dundreary was "spoony." Georgina was simply
a foil for the ridiculous fop's unconscious and wonderfully
uttered witticisms, and she had little more to do
than to keep her countenance while the audiences
roared with laughter at Sothern's wild but always
coherent absurdities of speech and manner. Under
this trying ordeal I have seen many Georginas break<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
down and laugh heartily with their "kind friends in
front," and I have reason to know that the mischief-loving
Sothern, at the risk of missing his own points,
often tried to make them do so.</p>

<p>Of the sweet "Spirit of the Future," as this
stage lay figure playing with the restless "Spirit of
the Hour," Clement Scott has said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"When Ellen Terry played Georgina she was a
young girl of enchanting loveliness. She was the ideal
of every pre-Raphaelite painter, and had hair, as De
Musset says, '<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">comme le blé</i>.' I always sympathised
with Dundreary when he, within whispering distance
of Ellen Terry's harvest-coloured hair, said: 'It
makes a fellow feel awkward when he's talking to
the back of a person's head.'"</p>

<p>In the same inexhaustible play she was called
upon, a little later on, to enact the prettily limned
Mary Meredith. She says she did it "vilely"; but
neither critics nor audiences agreed with her.</p>

<p>Sothern, both on and off the stage, and both with
men and women, was one of the most popular beings
of his day, and it is therefore all the more surprising
to hear Ellen Terry say that she could never like him.
She admired him, but she could not understand his
mania for practical joking. By some this has been
thought odd, for it is known that she herself dearly
loves a joke. I think I can explain her prejudice.
Having begun one of his "sells," as he called them,
Sothern did not know when to leave off, and he never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
seemed to reflect that it was unkind to practise his
pleasantries on nervous young actors.</p>

<p>That he did not mean to be unkind, and that if he
felt he had made a mistake or had gone too far he was
deeply penitent and anxious to make any atonement
in his power, I, who knew him so intimately, can
asseverate. But if he saw the chance of a "sell" he
could hardly resist temptation, and many of those
associated with him on the stage, and who did not
understand his bewildering sense of humour, suffered
in silence, and were secretly tortured by his odd and
incessant pranks. I have no doubt this was poor
Ellen Terry's position when she complains that he
teased her&mdash;made her forget her part, and "look like
an idiot." The following anecdote concerning the way
in which he treated me (his personal friend!) and a
little company of actors and actresses, working their
hardest to gain a word of approbation from the great
star of the period, will illustrate my meaning.</p>

<p>In the days of many years ago he accepted a
comedietta from my pen wildly called (Sothern gave
it its title) "My Wife's Father's Sister," and the little
piece was produced at the Theatre Royal, Brighton.
He was anxious that I should be present at its first
night, but I was unable to join him until its second
representation. I was to be his guest, but when I
entered his room at the Grand Hotel he seemed
amazed and discomforted to see me.</p>

<p>"What on earth brings <em>you</em> here?" he exclaimed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
"Why, to see you and my piece," I replied. "Then you didn't get my
telegram last night?" he inquired. I told him that I had received no
telegram and should be glad to know its purport. "Well," he said, in
a vexed tone of voice, "I wired to beg you as a personal favour to me
not to come to Brighton, but as you <i>are</i> here, we'll say no more about
it."</p>

<p>Of course this did not satisfy me, and on being very hard pressed,
he reluctantly told me that my poor little play had been a dead
failure, and that he had telegraphed to me to stay away because he
wanted to spare me humiliation.</p>

<p>"But," I said, in an agony of disappointment, "the newspapers speak
well of it!"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Sothern, "the critics here are good friends of mine,
and I persuaded them that it was a sorry task to break a butterfly on
a wheel. It was impossible for me at a moment's notice to get another
after-piece ready to put in its place, but to-night 'My Wife's Father's
Sister' will be played for the second and last time. Don't shirk seeing
it, it will be a useful, if painful, lesson to you, and at supper
to-night we'll try and find out where the fatal kink in it lies, for,
as you know, I felt certain that it was going to be a hit."</p>

<p>In spite of my friend's kindness, sympathy, and unbounded
hospitality, I, crushed with mortification, spent a wretched afternoon,
and in the early evening (Sothern, who was to play Dundreary, had
preceded me) I wended my sad way to the theatre. On my walk I met a
mutual friend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, how did the piece go last night?" he asked. "I was sorry I
couldn't be there to see."</p>

<p>Miserably I told him my bitter news, and how the play had failed.</p>

<p>"Then I believe it was Sothern's fault," he said. "He was half
mad on practical jokes last night, and one of the actors has told me
how he declared that <em>you</em> were in front, that you are a most
exacting and irritable author, and that you were intensely annoyed at
the grossly vulgar way in which, according to your reported views, your
work was interpreted. One by one the actors and actresses had from his
lips their dose of what they supposed, and <em>still</em> suppose,
to be <em>your</em> harsh criticism. 'Abominable!' 'Atrocious!' and
'Actionable' were among the mildest expressions you were said to have
used, and the poor people became so nervous that they hardly knew
what they were doing. At the end of the performance Sothern told them
collectively that you had left the theatre 'a shattered and prematurely
old man.'"</p>

<p>When I crept into an obscure corner of a private box that night,
expecting to witness the complete failure of a number of nerveless
artists to galvanise a dead play into life, I was very angry with
Sothern. I felt that I had been "butchered" to make a "Roman
Holiday," and I did not like the sensation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
But, to my bewilderment, the comedietta went capitally, and applause of
the right sort followed the fall of the curtain. At supper, Sothern,
with that marvellous diamond-like sparkle in his speaking blue-grey eye
which his friends so well remember, "gave away" the greater part of the
story. That delighted and delightful familiar twinkle was sufficient to
tell me the truth. "Oh!" I cried, "you have 'sold' me! I believe the
piece went as well <em>last</em> night as it did <em>to-night</em>!"</p>

<p>"Much better," he replied calmly. "I sent you no telegram, but I
could not resist the sell. Now light a cigar and be happy."</p>

<p>And I was happy until, in the early hours of the morning, Sothern
said, "By the way, I wonder how your supper party is getting on?"</p>

<p>"My supper party?" I asked. "What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Oh," he replied, as he lighted another cigar, "now I think of
it, I forgot to tell you that I mentioned to the performers in 'My
Wife's Father's Sister' that you were so delighted with their marked
improvement on the second night of the production that you wished to
welcome them at a little supper you had ordered at the 'Old Ship.'"</p>

<p>And I heard the next day that the poor "sold" people went and waited
and came supperless away. And then I sneaked out of Brighton, leaving
"My Wife's Father's Sister" behind me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>I have never seen her since. This is only an example of Sothern's
constant and, it must be owned, often exasperating practices. It was
wonderful that some of his escapades were so easily forgiven, but
those who narrowly watched his marvellous dexterity in keeping up
the deceptions of his rapid invention, causing one practical joke
to overtake another like sea waves; those who could understand his
infectious vitality and quick sense of humour, were, even when they
chanced to be the wrathful objects of his extravagancies, lost in
admiration for his peculiar genius.</p>

<p>In some way his temperament must have resembled that of the great
David Garrick, whom he so often impersonated on the stage.</p>

<p>Of the English Roscius it has been said that he was always acting,
whether upon the stage, in his own house, in the houses of his friends,
and even in the streets.</p>

<p>He would suddenly stop in the middle of a public thoroughfare,
and look up at the sky as if he saw something remarkable, until a
crowd gathered about him, and then he would turn away with the wild
stare of insanity. He could not sit down to have his hair dressed
without terrifying the barber by making his face assume every shade of
expression, from the deepest tragic gloom to the vacancy of idiotcy.</p>

<p>His enemies ascribed these feats to a restless egotism that
must always be conspicuous, but might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
they not rather have arisen from the over-exuberant animal spirits of
"the cheerfulest man of his age"?</p>

<p>Such, in a great measure, was Sothern's nature, and it is not to be
wondered at if it sometimes jarred upon those who had to act with him,
and who were desirous to do justice to themselves. I cannot suppose
that his "My Wife's Father's Sister's" victims loved him any more than
they did the innocent writer of these lines, or than Ellen Terry seems
to have done.</p>

<p>Such things are to be understood, but I cannot mention Edward Askew
Sothern without recording the fact that to his intimate friends he
was ever the most consistent, affectionate, and generous of men. At
the hospitable table of Henry Irving I once met the famous American
tragedian, the late John M'Cullough. Turning to me in the course of the
evening, he said: "I am told you are a close friend of Ned Sothern's;"
and when I answered "Yes," he said, as if it were a matter of course,
"Then you love him."</p>

<p>And that of all men who really knew him well was true.</p>

<p>But if in Sothern Ellen Terry chanced to find an uncongenial
fellow-actor, in another member of the Haymarket Company she made a
friend, destined to play with her in some of her greatest subsequent
triumphs. This was that grand old actor, Henry Howe, "dear old
Mr. Howe," as she calls him, who was a staunch member of the once
celebrated band of Haymarket comedians for forty years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>Howe played the part of father to "the little treasure"; his kindly,
winsome ways at once won her sympathy, and in the now forgotten play no
scene was more successful than that in which the supposed parent and
child, moved by the pathos of each other's acting, united in genuine
tears.</p>

<p>Macready aptly described Charles Kemble as a first-rate actor
of second-rate parts, and the same somewhat lukewarm praise may be
attributed to Henry Howe; but he was an actor who lent distinction to
his profession, and his honoured memory should surely be kept green.</p>

<p>It is odd to think of an actor being a Quaker, and yet throughout
his long life Howe was a loyal member of the Society of Friends. It
was the impression made upon him, when he was a mere boy, by the
soul-inspiring acting of Edmund Kean as King Lear, that gave him a
passion for the stage. With a cousin of his own age he contrived to
take stolen pleasure in the gallery of Drury Lane Theatre, and on
his way home, half-choked with enthusiasm and emotion, he said to
his comrade, "I am going to be an actor." His family and friends did
their utmost to dissuade him from this rash step, but fate willed that
it should be taken, and the stage-struck lad became one of the most
accomplished and self-respecting of the actors of his day.</p>

<p>Although he never paraded it, I think he was
always influenced by his simple religious faith. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
well remember how, in the kindest of ways, he would warn the young
fellows of those Sothern-Haymarket days against keeping late (and
possibly loose) hours in London after curtain-fall. I can hear him now
telling us of his long midnight walks to his beloved country home at
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Isleworth'">Isleworth</ins> (beyond Brentford!), and of his active morning work in his
garden on those days on which rehearsals did not call him to town. "And
at such times," he would say, with a good-humoured shake of his head,
"some of you are lying in bed trying to cure carefully manufactured
head-aches."</p>

<p>Years afterwards he became a notable member of the Lyceum Company,
and served until his death under the banner of Henry Irving. During
this period, and when with his chief and comrades he was fulfilling a
fortnight's engagement in Birmingham, my good old friend, when on a
visit to my house, made me his confidant in a little personal trouble.
It was this. During the two weeks of his stay in the city he had only
been called upon to act twice, and then only in small parts.</p>

<p>I naturally thought that he felt hurt at apparent neglect,
and I tried to say a few consolatory words to him. "Oh, it isn't
<em>that</em>!" said the fine old gentleman, "I've no feeling on
<em>that</em> score; but the fact is, I am being paid a very handsome
salary, and doing next to nothing for it. As things are, I know
I am not earning it. I must speak to Irving about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
it, and tell him either my stipend must be reduced, or I must go."
Shortly afterwards I saw him again. His fine face was radiant with
smiles and his spirits were buoyant. He had had his interview with
Irving, and the upshot of it was that no alteration could be made
in his emolument, that he would be called upon to act whenever the
repertory contained a part that could be suitably allotted to him, and
that his "chief" would regard it as a great personal sorrow if his
distinguished name did not figure as a member of his company.</p>

<p>Thus did the most tactful and generous of managers make a
time-honoured servant of the public easy in his pocket, and supremely
happy in the retention of his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">amour propre</i>.</p>

<p>Frequenters of the Lyceum will remember how, even in the smallest of
parts, Henry Howe was always sure of a hearty reception.</p>

<p>This is only one amongst a thousand of the acts of tender
consideration and unstinted liberality shown by Henry Irving towards
those who have acted for and with him.</p>

<p>But besides "little treasures," Georginas, and Mary Merediths, there
were other opportunities for Ellen Terry at the Haymarket. She had the
sympathy and encouragement of such sterling actors as Henry Compton and
William Farren, the Chippendales, and the always kindly and attentive
Walter Gordon, a gentleman who, on his retirement from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
stage, resumed his own name, and was well known as William Aylmer
Gowing.</p>

<p>She played Julia in "The Rivals" to the Faulkland of Howe, the
Sir Anthony Absolute of Chippendale, the Captain Absolute of William
Farren, the Bob Acres of Buckstone, and the Mrs. Malaprop of Mrs.
Chippendale. In "Much Ado about Nothing" she appeared as Hero to the
Beatrice of Louisa Angell, and when that lady appeared as Letitia Hardy
in "The Belle's Stratagem," Ellen Terry was the Lady Touchwood. Let it
not be forgotten that her own bewitching Letitia was destined to be one
of the most attractive of her comedy impersonations at the Lyceum.</p>

<p>Thanks to Sothern, I was in those days quite at home at the
Haymarket Theatre, and in "Walter Gordon" I found a true friend and
adviser when, later on, I tried to write on things theatrical. He did
much admirable work with his own pen, and was full of good stories of
famous actors and actresses with whom he had played. I remember how
he told me of an ephemeral entertainment by Sterling Coyne, entitled
"Buckstone at Home," in which Ellen Terry, being then in a frolicsome
mood, made an unexpected effect and sensation. In this wild production
she had to appear as Britannia, and she was surrounded by the Knights
of the Round Table. These stalwarts were supposed to be unable to
remove a certain "property" stone, concerning which there was much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
superstition to the effect that it was so heavy that mortal could
not stir it. The situation was meant to be taken seriously, but the
light-hearted Britannia&mdash;possibly annoyed with the absurdity of
the production and the poverty of her part in it, came forward, took
the mock boulder in her hands, "played ball" with the flimsy thing,
at the same time gleefully crying out&mdash;"Why, a child could toss
it!"</p>

</div>

<p>I wonder what she would have said if the recreant Sothern had thus
committed himself! But in spite of occasional fits of joyousness this
Haymarket engagement seems to have been a disappointment to her. She
regarded it as one of her "lost opportunities,"&mdash;and in later
days she would have given much to "find it again." By her own wish,
however, it came to an early end. No doubt the ordeal was a severe one.
She was exceedingly young, and she was called upon to vie with the
picked comedians of her day. She acquitted herself not only bravely
but with distinction, but no doubt her ever supersensitive nature (the
inevitable if undesirable nature of the true artist) often whispered
to her that she had blundered where she had really made a marked
impression. Mrs. Siddons was wont to say that the player's nerves must
be "made of cart ropes." Ellen Terry's highly-strung organisation seems
to move on the slenderest of silken threads, and no doubt in those early
days the strain of her public appearances were often a torment to her. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
June of 1863 Edward Leman Blanchard records her appearance at the
Princess's Theatre, and her performance of Desdemona to the Othello of
Walter Montgomery. This was an interesting event, for it witnessed the
return of the little Mamillius and Prince Arthur of former days to the
scene of her early successes, and this in a Shakespearean part in which
she subsequently won great renown at the Lyceum.</p>

<p>Not long after this, and to the intense regret of those who were
carefully watching the rapid progress of her artistic career, she
temporarily left the stage. Probably she found its duties too irksome
to one of her restless, self-doubting nature. Men and women endowed
with unusual talents are generally prone to have their own way, and it
is perhaps well for the full fruition of those great gifts, that are to
be a present boon and future memory to mankind, that they should follow
it. Who would wantonly put Pegasus in the Pound?</p>

<p>Even in those (to her) unpromising "Georgina" days Ellen Terry had
shown real genius. Genius, as William Winter has beautifully put it, is
the petrel, and like the petrel it loves the freedom of the winds and
the waves.</p>

<p>Just as the petrel of the ocean appears during its flight sometimes
to touch the surface of the waves with its feet, so she had daintily
fluttered across the boards which were for a time to lose her.</p>

<p class="p4">KATE TERRY</p>


<p>Now that Ellen Terry has for a time said good-bye to the stage that
so sorely missed her, I may pause to glance at the brilliant career
of her elder sister Kate, who had been, as we have seen, the constant
comrade of her 'prentice days. Apart from her conspicuous successes
in the youthful Shakespearean characters at the Princess's, she had,
before her engagement at that house came to an end, made a profound
impression by the purity and pathos of her acting as Cordelia (she
was a very young Cordelia) to the King Lear of Charles Kean. This was
in the April of 1858. Even at that early age she had, as the saying
goes, "arrived," and would no doubt have been promptly secured by any
of the then existing London managers. But, wise in his generation, and
conscious of his daughter's conspicuous talents, her father decided
that she must have more practice before taking that place on the boards
to which she should become entitled.</p>

<p>It is interesting to show here one of the Charles Kean play-bills in
which Kate Terry figured. To-day it reads curiously as the programme of
a fashionable West End theatre.</p>

<p class="p5"><i>VIVANT REGINA ET PRINCEPS.</i></p>


<p class="p7a">The result of her father's wise policy was that Kate Terry
was fully equipped when, in 1860, she commenced her engagement at the St.
James's Theatre, under the management of Mr. Alfred Wigan, whose company
included Miss Herbert (who soon became the manageress of the house), Mrs. Alfred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
Wigan, Miss Nelly Moore, Mr. Terry, Mr. Dewar, and Mr. Emery. Young,
beautiful, gifted, well practised in the art that she evidently loved,
Kate Terry was well calculated to secure the praise of the critics and
the heart of the public. At first the characters entrusted to her were
comparatively small, but she industriously tended the firmly planted
sapling that was destined to grow, flourish, and yield glorious as well
as abundant fruit.</p>

<p>Even the greatest of histrionic geniuses have to wait for their
chances, and Kate Terry's first real opportunity did not come until
1862.</p>

<p>A version, by Mr. Horace Wigan, of Victorien Sardou's fine comedy,
"Nos Intimes," entitled "Friends or Foes," was in course of presentation,
and Miss Herbert's company then included the honoured names of George
Vining, Frank and Mrs. Frank Mathews, W. H. Stephens, and F. Charles.
This play has been made familiar to later and present-day playgoers as
"Peril," the clever adaptation by Clement Scott and B. C. Stephenson,
which seems likely to hold the stage for many a long year to come. It
proved one of the trump cards of the Bancrofts at the old Prince of
Wales's Theatre, and its subsequent revivals have always been attended by
success. The Lady Ormonde of "Friends or Foes" was, of course, played by
Miss Herbert, and Kate Terry had to content herself with quite a minor
part; but she was the conscientious understudy of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
manageress, and, when that delightful artiste suddenly fell ill, the
burden of the piece&mdash;at a moment's notice&mdash;had to be borne upon
the shoulders of the younger actress.</p>

<p>Her triumph was instantaneous and complete. Bravely, and with
consummate skill, she went through her trying ordeal, and when the
curtain fell it was evident that her permanent popularity on the London
stage was secure.</p>

<p>It is ridiculous to depend upon that "will-o'-the-wisp" called "luck";
but there is no doubt that if we are ready for it, and promptly avail
ourselves of it, <i>chance</i> will sometimes do us a good turn.</p>

<p>But no one can afford to neglect the truth of the old warning
reminding us that opportunities are very sensitive things, and that if
you slight them on their first visit you seldom see them again. Of that
memorable performance at the St. James's, Clement Scott says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"On that never-to-be-forgotten night this young girl, Kate Terry, made
an astounding success. Her name was scarcely known; no one knew that we
had amongst us a young actress of so much beauty, talent, and, what was
more wonderful still, true dramatic power, for the temptation scene wants
acting, and not the kind of trifling that we see in these modern and
amateurish days."</p>

<p>The next morning, Tom Taylor in the <cite>Times</cite>
let himself go, and blew the trumpet in praise of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
new actress, Kate Terry. Her fame was made from that minute. She never
turned back.</p>

<p>Quickly she became the stage divinity of her day, and she remained the
idol of London playgoers until, on her early marriage, she retired into
private life. Those who saw her will never forget either her personal
charm or the perfection of her art, and they will, I think, like to
take a glimpse with me into a cherished past. We are told that times of
special happiness should be regarded as a sort of reserve fund, to be
drawn upon in dark or cloudy days, and the evenings of long ago, when we
delighted in the acting of Kate Terry, were times of exceeding happiness.
The little world of the theatre in which we have revelled is still open
to us, and it is always pleasant to turn over the brightest pages of its
history.</p>

<p>Many of us know how old fox-hunters are never so happy as when they
are recalling the glorious "runs" of the past. How they met at Quinton
Cross Roads; found "one of the right sort" in Bamkin's Gorse; ran him
at a rattling pace over Lickford Common; had a check in Bowler's Wood;
lost him in Messer's Osier Beds; found him again, and followed him over
that dangerous water jump, Priddis Brook, low lying, as it broadly flows
between thick quick-set hedges; and finally ran him to earth in Linnecor
Coppice.</p>

<p>So are old playgoers supremely content when with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
congenial souls they discuss the famous and favourite actors and
actresses they have seen and admired in bygone days. So they will follow
them from their initial efforts in the provinces, through their series of
triumphs in this or that London theatre. To such theatrical enthusiasts
as these their collections of old play-bills are as precious and replete
with pleasurable reminiscences as are the "pads" of many defunct reynards
nailed to the stable doors of the fox-hunter.</p>

<p>At about the time when Kate Terry made her unmistakable mark at the
St. James's, Charles Albert Fechter was the actor-hero of the hour.</p>

<p>He came to fulfil his trying ordeal in London with great credentials.
Charles Dickens had described seeing him first, quite by accident, in
Paris, having strolled in to a little theatre there one night. "He was
making love to a woman," Dickens wrote, "and he so elevated her as well
as himself by the sentiment in which he enveloped her, that they trod in
a purer ether, and in another sphere, quite lifted out of the present.
'By heavens!' I said to myself, 'a man who can do this can do anything. I
never saw two people more purely and instantly elevated by the power of
love. The man has genius in him which is unmistakable.'"</p>

</div>

<p>In due course Fechter, having made his triumph on English boards,
became the manager of the Lyceum Theatre. It was a great undertaking for
a French actor, for he had to contend against the conservatism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
of not only our audiences, but of English actors and critics. That he
was the best "love-maker" our stage had seen was readily admitted, and
the fascination of his love-scenes was certain to be an attraction. But
no actor can make the success of a love-scene unless he is assisted by a
perfectly accomplished and responsive actress. Who was to be the heroine
of Fechter's reign at the Lyceum? She was found in Kate Terry, and she
right worthily shared in his notable victories.</p>

<p>One of the earliest productions was the first English version of the
French play that (in spite of many other and differently named versions)
has been made familiar to us as "The Duke's Motto." In this Kate Terry
appeared as Blanche de Nevers, and in speaking of the impersonation
Charles Dickens, who, for the sake of his friend Fechter, was inclined to
be very critical, said that it was "perfectly charming,"&mdash;"the very
best piece of womanly tenderness he had ever seen on the stage."</p>

<p>No doubt Kate Terry contributed largely to Fechter's Lyceum successes.
She could not only act, but she so threw herself into her characters that
she could <i>listen</i> to those who acted with her, and let her audiences not
only see, but believe that she was listening with all her heart and soul.
The exercise of this rarely displayed histrionic gift was invaluable in
the beautiful love-scenes of Fechter.</p>

<p>But in her girlish days Kate Terry had shown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
that she understood the value of action on the stage, and knew that when
deftly handled it could make an even deeper impression than words.</p>

<p>Speaking of Charles Kean's great production of "Henry the Fifth" at
the Princess's in 1859 the notoriously keen critic of the <i>Athenæum</i>
said:&mdash;"The union of England and France in one kingdom is the
ambitious sentiment of the play, and the heroism of the English character
the spirit that pervades the scenes. This is exemplified in the small as
well as the great incidents, and in none, in acting, did it come out more
significantly than in the little part of the boy belonging to the Pistol
group of characters at the end of the first act. Miss Kate Terry, as the
impersonator of the brave youth, in the heroic and pleasing attitude
with which he listened to the sound of the drum, and the measured march
with which he followed delightedly the spirit-stirring music, showed us
at once the sympathetic gallantry of the English lad going to the wars.
There was in it an intelligible indication of the wonderful daring by
which the battle of Agincourt was won. To men who were once such lads
as he nothing was impossible. The trait was well brought out; and that
little bit of acting, in regard to its completeness, was the gem of the
performance."</p>

<p>And so Kate Terry shared in Fechter's Lyceum conquests, and in "Bel
Demonio, a Love Story," adapted by John Brougham from the French drama<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
"L'Abbaye de Castro," she played Lena to his Angelo. A little later she
was the "pretty Ophelia" to the much discussed Hamlet of Fechter, and
again honours were divided.</p>

<p>How critics differed concerning the new Hamlet!</p>

<p>Writing long after the glamour of the impersonation has passed away,
Clement Scott has told us how Hamlet was represented "in a new way, in
a fresh style, with carefully considered new business; with a sweetly
pathetic face showing 'the fruitful river of the eye,' and in a long
flaxen Danish wig.</p>

<p>"'A Frenchman play Hamlet!'" he says. "There was a yell of execration
in the camp of the old school of playgoers, and the feathers began to
fly. Hamlet in a fair wig indeed! Hamlet in broken English! Oh! you
should have heard the shouts of indignation, the babble of prejudice! The
upholders of the mouthing, moaning, gurgling Hamlets&mdash;the Hamlets
who obeyed every precept in his advice to the players, and 'imitated
nature so abominably,' the Hamlets who strutted and stormed&mdash;held
indignation meetings at their clubs, and metaphorically threw their
'scratch wigs' into the air with rage and indignation.</p>

<p>"I, of course, became the easiest convert to the new Fechter school,
and elected to serve under his brilliant banner. In fact, I will candidly
own that I never quite understood Hamlet until I saw Fechter play the
Prince of Denmark. Phelps and Charles Kean impressed me with the play;
but with Fechter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
I loved the play, and was charmed as well as fascinated by the
player."</p>

<p>I am among the many who yielded to that charm, and wish that the
delightful experience of seeing Fechter's Hamlet and Kate Terry's Ophelia
might be repeated.</p>

<p>When, early in 1870, Fechter left England for America, Charles Dickens
contributed to the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> an article in his praise. "I
cannot," said the great novelist, "wish my friend a better audience than
he will find in the American people, and I cannot wish them a better
actor than they will find in my friend." Charles Dickens, it will be
remembered, was one of the keenest of all dramatic critics.</p>

<p>His admiration for Fechter's much discussed rendering of Hamlet is
expressed in the following words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Perhaps no innovation in art was ever accepted with so much favour
by so many intelligent persons, pre-committed to, and pre-occupied by,
another system, as Fechter's Hamlet. I take this to have been the case
(as it unquestionably was in London), not because of its picturesqueness,
not because of its novelty, not because of its many scattered beauties,
but because of its perfect consistency with itself. Its great and
satisfying originality was in its possessing the merit of a distinctly
conceived and executed idea. Fechter's Hamlet, a pale woe-begone
Norseman, with long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
flaxen hair, wearing a strange garb, never associated with the part upon
the English stage (if ever seen there at all), and making a piratical
sweep upon the whole fleet of little theatrical prescriptions without
meaning, or like Dr. Johnson's celebrated friend, with only one idea in
them, and that a wrong one, never could have achieved its extraordinary
success but for its animation by one pervading purpose, to which all
changes were made intelligently "sub-servient."</p>

<p>And yet of Fechter's Hamlet in America, William Winter, that greatest
and most deservedly honoured of transatlantic critics and authorities on
things theatrical, has said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"About 1861 Charles Fechter appeared upon the English stage and gave
an extraordinary performance of Hamlet. It subsequently (1869-70) reached
America. It was 'the rage' on both sides of the sea. In a technical sense
it was a performance of ability, but it was chiefly remarkable for light
hair and bad English. Fanny Kemble tells a story of a lady who, at a
dinner in London, was asked by a neighbouring guest whether she had seen
Mr. Fechter as Hamlet. 'No,' she said, 'I have not; and I think I should
not care to hear the English blank verse spoken by a foreigner.' The
inquirer gazed meditatively upon his plate for some time, and then said,
'But, Hamlet <i>was</i> a foreigner, wasn't he?'</p>

<p>"That is the gist of the whole matter. We were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
to have the manner of 'nature' in blank verse. We were to have Hamlet in
light hair, because Danes are sometimes blonde. We were to have the great
soliloquy on life and death omitted, because it
stops the action of the play.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> We were to have the
blank verse turned into a foreigner's English prose. We were to have
Hamlet crossing his legs upon the gravestone, as if he were Sir Charles
Coldstream; and this was to be 'nature.' Mr. Fechter's plan may have been
finely executed, but it was radically wrong, and it could not be rightly
accepted. Some courage was required to oppose it, because Mr. Fechter had
come to us (to me among others) personally commended by no less a man
than the great Charles Dickens."</p>

<p>But if critics differed with regard to the merits of Fechter's Hamlet,
there was a perfect chorus of praise for the exquisitely portrayed
Ophelia of Kate Terry. It is interesting to note that this victory was
won on the same stage on which, in the same part, Ellen Terry was to
commence her stage history-making engagement with Henry Irving.</p>

<p>When Fechter's brief reign at the Lyceum came to an end, Kate Terry
went to support Henry Neville at the Olympic Theatre. This admirable
actor was then at the height of his still well sustained popularity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>Handsome, graceful, endowed with a beautiful voice, and a master of
his art, Henry Neville was an ideal hero of romance, and though to-day he
elects to play quieter parts, and to delight his audiences with his rich
appreciation of comedy, he looks as young and dashing as he did in the
days of 1864.</p>

<p>Kate Terry's first appearance at the little Wych Street playhouse
was in a piece entitled "The Hidden Hand," an adaptation by Tom Taylor,
from the French drama by MM. D'Ennery and Edmond, <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'callid'">called</ins> "L'Aieule." She
and Henry Neville distinguished themselves in the characters of Lord
and Lady Penarvon, and the company included Miss Louisa Moore, Miss
Lydia Foote, Miss Nelly Farren, and Charles Coghlan. Later came Sterling
Coyne's comedy called "Everybody's Friend," which, under the title of
"The Widow Hunt," was destined in later years to be made famous by that
admirable American comedian, John Sleeper Clarke. Who, having seen it,
will ever forget the delicious drollery of his Major Wellington de Boots?
The Major of the Olympic days was Mr. Walcot, who, although announced as
an American actor, was an Englishman by birth. Kate Terry was the Mrs.
Swansdown, Henry Neville the Felix Featherley, and Mrs. Leigh Murray Mrs.
Major de Boots.</p>

<p>Other successes were made in Tom Taylor's five-act drama "Settling
Day," and the same playwright's "The Serf." The production of the latter
piece being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
the "benefit" night of the gifted actress, she delivered an address
written for her by the grateful author.</p>

<p>In "Twelfth Night" Kate Terry doubled the parts of Viola and
Sebastian; and a notable hit was made in Tom Taylor's stage version of
Miss Braddon's novel "Henry Dunbar." In Leicester Buckingham's "Love's
Martyrdom" she again distinguished herself.</p>

<p>On June 20, 1866, she again took a benefit at the theatre she had
served so well, and on this occasion appeared for the first time as
Julia in "The Hunchback" of Sheridan Knowles, and once more delivered an
address specially written for her by Tom Taylor. But the great event of
the evening was the appearance (also for the first time) of Ellen Terry
as the sprightly Helen. In order that she might serve her sister she made
this brief departure from her retirement, and acted with great spirit and
animation.</p>

<p>A little later on she appeared at the Prince's Theatre at Manchester
in the first performance of a new play by Dion Boucicault originally
called "The Two Lives of Mary Leigh" but subsequently renamed "Hunted
Down." This proved to be a memorable evening. Not only did Kate Terry
add to her laurels as the heroine, but Henry Irving, in the character
of Rawdon Scudamore, made his first great impression. Hitherto he
had only been known as a very earnest actor in the provincial stock
companies&mdash;but in this play he found his chance, seized it, and made
his mark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>Irving, who was then most anxious to get to London, made a stipulation
with Boucicault before he accepted the part to the effect that if he
succeeded he should have the opportunity of appearing in it in the
production of the play in the metropolis. This was acceded to, and
on the opening night the dramatist was so struck with his splendid
performance that he induced his friend and brother playwright, Charles
Reade, to travel to Manchester in order that he might see this remarkable
impersonation. It was then that these two experts decided that in Henry
Irving they saw the coming leading actor of his day.</p>

<p>On November 5, 1866, "Hunted Down" was produced at the St. James's
Theatre, with Miss Herbert in the character created by Kate Terry;
Rawdon Scudamore at once "took the town" and excited the admiration of
the critics, and so the name and fame of Henry Irving were made out of
material that has never faded. It is curious to remember that our famous
actor's first great success was made with Kate Terry, and that most of
his later triumphs have been shared with Ellen Terry.</p>

<p>Kate Terry's next London home was the Adelphi Theatre. There she
created the character of Anne Carew in Tom Taylor's evergreen play
"A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing" (a part that was in after years most
beautifully played by Mrs. Kendal at the St. James's), and won great
favour in "A Sister's Penance," by Tom Taylor and A. W. Dubourg. In the
latter production<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
she was associated with Miss Fanny Hughes, John Billington, and Hermann
Vezin. "Good acting by Kate Terry" is the verdict pronounced upon
the piece in the pages of Edward Leman Blanchard's happily preserved
diary.</p>

<p>Probably Kate Terry's sojourn at the Adelphi will be best remembered
by her exquisitely tender rendering of the sweet character of Dora in
Charles Reade's happy stage version of Tennyson's poem bearing that
name.</p>

<p>We all know the touching story telling that&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"With farmer Allan at the farm abode</div>
  <div class="i0">William and Dora; William was his son,</div>
  <div class="i0">And she his niece&mdash;"</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We remember how the stern old man desired that the
cousins should marry, and we know that while Dora
would willingly give her heart to William, he is cold
to her. We recall his scene with his father and how
he said&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"I cannot marry Dora; by my life</div>
  <div class="i0">I will not marry Dora." Then the old man</div>

  <div class="i0">"You will not, boy! you dare to answer thus!</div>

  <div class="i0">And so it shall be now for me."</div>

<p>Then we follow William out of the house whose doors are mercilessly
closed behind him, see him marry his sweetheart Mary, know that all
things fail with him until despair brings him to his death-bed. Now we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
realise the depth and unselfishness of Dora's love. She goes to the aid
of the woman who has really spoilt her life's dream of happiness, and
through her dead darling's child endeavours to secure poor stricken
Mary's prosperity by a reconciliation with the still angry and always
stubborn farmer Allan. Her simple, loving plan succeeds. The child
softens the obdurate heart&mdash;</p>

 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Yes, we all know the finely conceived and tenderly told story of love,
anger, self-effacement, and forgiveness, but I do not think that any
of us realised the manifold beauties of Dora's character until it was
interpreted to us by Kate Terry. The portrait was painted in the most
delicate tints, but beneath the surface of it the pure mind and devoted
heart were ever apparent. The impersonation must have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
truly satisfying to the poet who always had a longing
to see the children of his fancy on the stage.</p>

<p>The critic of the <i>Examiner</i> was right when he spoke of Kate Terry's
Dora as "still a thoroughly country girl, simple, yet shrewd, with depths
of womanly feeling, and little feminine piquancies; meek as a mouse, but
with something in her of the power of angels, she trips on her way of
quiet loving-kindness in a shabby hat and cotton gloves, and morsel of
silk cape over a dress with a narrow skirt. Her uncle gives her money
for fine dress; but of that, and of all that she can call hers to give,
the utmost toll is taken for the sustenance of the unhappy outcasts.
How touching it all is, and true with the real poetry of life, we feel
throughout; the interest in the character rises steadily as the play goes
on, and culminates as it should in the last scene."</p>

<p>It would be very wrong to take leave of Dora without saying a word
of praise with regard to the Farmer Allan of Henry Neville. It was a
virile, as well as a pathetic, embodiment of a firmly drawn but not too
sympathetic, and, consequently, very difficult character.</p>

<p>Soon after this, the rumour reached envious playgoers that Kate Terry
was about to become the wife of Mr. Arthur Lewis&mdash;a gentleman very
well known in literary and artistic circles&mdash;and that her marriage
would involve her retirement from the stage.</p>

<p>Crowded were the houses that then assembled to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
see their favourite as Juliet, Beatrice, Julia, Pauline, and in other
great characters. On the 2nd September, 1867, she gave her farewell
performance, and the occasion was thus recorded in the <cite>Times</cite>:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is seldom that the theatrical chronicler has to describe a
scene like that at the Adelphi on Saturday, when Miss Kate Terry took
her farewell of the stage as Juliet. Successes, demonstrations, and
ovations of a kind may be made to order; but the scene of Saturday
was one of those genuine, spontaneous, and irrepressible outbursts of
public recognition which carry their credentials of sincerity along with
them. The widespread feeling that the stage is losing one of its chosen
ornaments had been manifested by the full houses, more and more crowded
on each successive night, which, even at this deadest of the dead season,
have been attracted to the Adelphi by Miss Terry's farewell performances.
Their attraction came to its climax and its close on Saturday, when
the theatre was crammed from the orchestra to the remotest nook in the
gallery where a spectator could press or perch, with such an audience as
we have never before seen gathered within its walls.</p>

<p>"At the conclusion of the tragedy, in the course of which Miss Terry
was called for at the end of each act, except the fourth, when the good
taste of the more intelligent part of the audience suppressed the demand,
Miss Terry came on before the curtain in obedience to a thundering
summons from every part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
of the house, and almost overcome with the combined excitement of the
part and the occasion, stood for some moments curtseying and smiling
under the showers of bouquets and the storm of kindly greeting. Nor when
she had retired with her armful of flowers&mdash;looking in the white
robe and dishevelled hair of Juliet's death scene, as she used to look in
Ophelia&mdash;was the audience satisfied. Again Miss Terry was recalled,
and again she appeared to receive the loud and long-continued plaudits
of the crowd. Then the stalls began to clear. But the storm of voices
and clapping of hands continued from pit, boxes, and gallery, through
the overture of the farce, swelling till it threatened to grow into a
tempest. The curtain rose for the farce; still the thunder roared. One of
the actors, quite inaudible in the clamour, began the performance, but
the roar grew louder and louder, till at last Mr. Phillips came on, in
the dress of Friar Lawrence, and with a stolidity so well assumed that
it seemed perfectly natural, asked, in the stereo-typed phrase of the
theatre, the pleasure of the audience. '<em>Kate Terry!</em>' was the reply from
a chorus of a thousand stentorian voices; and then the fair favourite of
the night appeared once more, pale, and dressed to leave the theatre,
and when the renewed roar of recognition had subsided, in answer to her
appealing dumb show, spoke, with pathetic effort, a few hesitating words,
evidently the inspiration of the moment, but more telling than any set
speech, to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
effect:&mdash;'How I wish from my heart I could tell you how I feel
your kindness, not to-night only, but through the many years of my
professional life. What can I say to you but thanks, thanks and
good-bye!' After this short and simple farewell, under a still louder
salvo of acclamation, unmistakably proving itself popular by its hearty
uproariousness, the young actress, almost overpowered by the feelings of
the moment, retired with faltering steps, and the crowded audience poured
out of the house, their sudden exit <i>en masse</i> being in itself one of the
most flattering tributes to the actress whose last appearance had drawn
them together.</p>

<p>"We have to turn over the pages of theatrical history in order to
find a parallel to this demonstration of affection coupled to gratitude.
And after the excitement of it was over, we, who had learnt to love
her perfectly portrayed art and sweet presence, sighed to think that
she would no longer grace the stage." Continuing, the <i>Times</i> critic
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"This remarkable manifestation of popular favour and regard is worth
recording, not only as a striking theatrical incident, which those who
were present can never forget, but because it proves that the frequenters
of even the pit and gallery of a theatre where, till Miss Terry came,
the finer springs of dramatic effect have very rarely been drawn on, can
rapidly be brought to recognise and value acting of a singularly refined
and delicate kind&mdash;so refined and delicate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
indeed that some of those who profess to guide the public taste have
been apt to insist on its wanting physical power. On Saturday night it
was made evident to demonstration, if other evidence had been wanting,
that Miss Terry had wrought her spells over the frequenters of pit and
gallery as well as of boxes and stalls. In the interests of refined
dramatic art this is a cheering set-off to many indications that seem to
make the other way. It shows that if the theatrical masses&mdash;those
who are roughly lumped up as the 'British Public'&mdash;are unable to
discriminate nicely between diamonds and paste, and so take a good deal
of coarse glassware for real stones, they are nevertheless susceptible
to the influence of refined, earnest, intelligent, and conscientious
acting when they have the rare opportunity of seeing it. How well Miss
Terry's acting merits all these epithets has been abundantly proved, not
only through her recent course of farewell performances, in which she has
filled a range of parts so widely different as to show a variety of power
in itself as rare as the grace, refinement, intelligence, and feeling she
has put into her acting from four years old to four-and-twenty."</p>

<p>Surely few actresses have won such heartfelt and well-merited words
of praise as these? No wonder that the thousands to whom she had given
endless delight grudged her her early won freedom from the perpetual
anxieties of stage life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>The Romeo of that eventful evening was her long-time stage comrade,
Henry Neville. For more than thirty years Kate Terry was absent from
the stage, but her name lived as a sweet memory in the minds of those
who had been fortunate enough to appreciate her rare and perfectly
cultured gifts. In the spring of 1898 she was induced to emerge from her
retirement to support her old friend, John Hare, in Mr. Stuart Ogilvie's
comedy, "The Master," at the Globe Theatre. Unluckily, the part that
she had consented to play afforded her few opportunities, the lady she
represented being simply a sweet and gentle wife and mother, with a
pleasant presence, a delightful smile, and a voice (the sweet voice of
days gone by) characterised by very winning tenderness. In itself a
charming part, but not one that gave scope for acting. But in this piece
she had the intense satisfaction of seeing her clever and beautiful
daughter, Miss Mabel Terry Lewis, make a marked impression on critical
West End audiences. Indeed, this charming young lady was one of the chief
attractions of "The Master."</p>

<p>In the autumn of the same year it was my privilege to sit by Mrs.
Arthur Lewis (and to hear the ever-to-be-remembered Kate Terry voice)
while her daughter was playing with John Hare and his company at the
Theatre Royal, Birmingham.</p>

<p>The piece was T. W. Robertson's "Ours." John<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Hare was in his original character of the Russian Prince Perovsky, and
the Blanche Haye was Miss Mabel Terry Lewis. The young artiste played the
part with an unaffected girlishness, imbued with true tenderness, that
touched all hearts, and it was evident that this latest recruit from the
famous Terry family was worthy to bear her honoured name.</p>

<p>It was pretty to watch the mother, the former heroine of a hundred
stage victories, as with the skill of an expert she noted how her sweet
young daughter won her way into the marked sympathy of her audience.</p>

<p>By way of interesting records of the early appearances of these famous
Terry sisters, I am able to produce here some matter that I hope my
readers will like to have brought under their notice.</p>

<p>The bills of the "Royal Entertainments" given "By Command" in 1852 and
1853 at Windsor Castle are now historic. It will be seen that in them
both Kate Terry and her father took part. The bill of "The Winter's Tale"
at the Princess's in which both of the sisters appeared was given to me
by Ellen Terry. It dates (after one hundred and two nights) her first
appearance as the baby boy Mamillius.</p>

<p>I am permitted to produce <i>in extenso</i> the letter
in which Charles Dickens, writing to his friend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
Macready, referred to the impression made upon him by Kate Terry's acting
with Fechter. There is a pleasant little history attached to this letter
of which, when he wrote it, Dickens never dreamt. In due course, and in
common, alas! with too many household gods, it came under the hammer of
the auctioneer. Henry Irving, with that delicate tact and taste which
distinguish his every action (and which must mean much preceding thought
in the life of an over busy man), bought it, and, on a Christmas Day,
sent it as the most delightful of Christmas cards to the Kate Terry of
those bygone times.</p>

<p>The letter from Tom Taylor to Ben Terry, in which he signifies his
warm approval of his daughter's acting in his greatest stage success,
"The Ticket-of-Leave Man," is very noteworthy.</p>

<p>The Manchester bill (October 4th and 5th, 1867) shows that Kate
Terry after her London farewell felt bound to say good-bye to her loyal
friends and admirers in Lancashire; that Charles Wyndham was among her
supporters; and that her sister Ellen (although she had declared that she
had retired from the stage) came to the fore in honour of her sister.</p>

<p>The picture of Kate Terry as Ariel was taken in 1856 when she was only
twelve years old!</p>

<p class="center"><i>Thursday, 19th February 1863.</i></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dearest Macready</span>,&mdash;I have just come
back from Paris, where the Readings&mdash;Copperfield,
Dombey and Trial, and Carol and Trial, have made
a sensation which modesty (my natural modesty)
renders it impossible for me to describe. You know
what a noble audience the Paris audience is! They
were at their very noblest with me.</p>

<p>"I was very much concerned by hearing hurriedly
from Georgey that you were ill. But when I came
home at night she showed me Kate's letter, and that
set me up again. Ah! you have the best of companions
and nurses, and can afford to be ill now and
then, for the happiness of being so brought through
it. But don't do it again, yet awhile, for all that.</p>

<p>"Legouvé (whom you remember in Paris as writing
for the Ristori) was anxious that I should bring
you the enclosed. A manly and generous effort, I
think? Regnier desired to be warmly remembered to
you. He has been losing money in speculation, but
looks just as of yore.</p>

<p>"Paris generally is about as wicked and extravagant
as in the days of the Regency. Madame Viardot
in the Orphée, most splendid. An opera of 'Faust,'
a very sad and noble rendering of that sad and
noble story. Stage management remarkable for some
admirable, and really poetical effects of light. In the
more striking situations, Mephistopheles surrounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
by an infernal red atmosphere of his own. Marguerite
by a pale blue mournful light. The two never blending.
After Marguerite has taken the jewels placed
in her way in the garden, a weird waning draws on,
and the bloom fades from the flowers, and the leaves
of the trees droop and lose their fresh green, and
mournful shadows overhang her chamber window,
which was innocently bright and gay at first. I
couldn't bear it, and gave in completely.</p>

<p>"Fechter doing wonders over the way here with
a picturesque French drama. Miss Kate Terry in a
small part in it, perfectly charming. You may remember
her making a noise years ago, doing a boy at
an Inn in the 'Courier of Lyons'? She has a tender
love-scene in this piece, which is a really beautiful
and artistic thing. I saw her do it at about three in
the morning of the day when the theatre opened,
surrounded by shavings and carpenters, and (of
course) with that inevitable hammer going; and I told
Fechter 'that is the very best piece of womanly tenderness
I have ever seen on the stage, and you will find
no Audience can miss it.' It is a comfort to add that
it was instantly seized upon, and is much talked of.</p>

<p>"Stanfield was very ill for some months; then
suddenly picked up, and is really rosy and jovial
again. Going to see him when he was very despondent,
I told him the story of Fechter's piece (then
in rehearsal) with appropriate action; fighting a duel
with the washing-stand, defying the bedstead, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
saving the life of the sofa-cushion. This so kindled
his old theatrical ardour, that I think he turned the
corner on the spot.</p>

<p>"With love to Mrs. Macready and Katie, and
(be still, my heart!) Benvenuta, and the exiled
Johnny (not too attentive at school, I hope?), and
the personally-unknown young Parr,&mdash;Ever, my
dearest Macready, your most affectionate</p>

you know my opinion of Kate's acting of May
Edwards in 'The Ticket-of-Leave Man,' here.</p>

<p>"My impression, in the most general form I can
state it, is simply this, that I have never had any one
character in any piece I have written, from first
to last, impersonated so entirely to my satisfaction.
She played with a grace, intelligence, and delicacy
and truth of feeling which completely carried away
the audience, and what is more&mdash;the author. If
she had played the part in town I should think it
would have doubled the success of the piece.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="p4">CHIEFLY AT THE QUEEN'S THEATRE</p>


<p>As the carrier-dove invariably, and often after a
period of long absence, wings its way back to its first
home, so in due time Ellen Terry, bringing with her
her long-desired message, fluttered back to the stage.
We have seen how in 1866 she appeared at the
Olympic, playing Helen to her sister's Julia, in "The
Hunchback." This was a special occasion, but in the
following year she, to the great delight of the public,
entered once more on a regular engagement. This
was at the Queen's Theatre in Longacre, and it came
at the right time. In the August of 1867 playgoers
had mourned for the loss of their beloved Kate
Terry. In the following October Ellen Terry was
at hand to take her place in their hearts. In the
previous June she had acted at the Holborn Theatre
in a short-lived play by Tom Taylor, entitled "The
Antipodes, or Ups and Downs of Life." In it she
had the support of a good company, which included
that wonderful actress Charlotte Saunders; but
though the drama dealt more or less effectively
with the racing element in England and the digging
element in Australia, it gave little or no chance to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
the performers, and is only mentioned here for purposes
of record.</p>

<p>It was at the Queen's that the new laurels were
to be won.</p>

<p>To the playgoers of to-day, who are accustomed
to the theatres of Shaftesbury Avenue and the Charing
Cross Road, and who are even inclined to regard
the historic Strand as a decaying home for the
players, it may seem strange to think of houses in
Holborn and Longacre, but the Queen's was in its
brief day very popular, and to mention it conjures
up many happy memories. It was there that John
L. Toole appeared in some of his best domestic
comedy parts, with such actors as Henry Irving,
Lionel Brough, Charles Wyndham, John Clayton,
and Henrietta Hodson for his comrades; it was there
that all London flocked to see Hermann Vezin in
F. C. Burnand's convincing drama, "The Turn of
the Tide" (founded upon the then deservedly popular
novel, "The Morals of Mayfair"), and in W. G. Wills's
first ambitious play, "Hinko"; and it was there that
Shakespearean students revelled in Samuel Phelps's
perfect impersonation of Bottom the Weaver, and
George Rignold's striking, nay, almost startling, rendering
of Caliban. Alas! for its many memories, the
Queen's Theatre is no more, and, instead of stage,
footlights, and auditorium, its walls encase the works
of a Longacre carriage-building firm.</p>

<p>When, on its opening night, Ellen Terry joined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
this now defunct playhouse, its fortunes were controlled
by Alfred Wigan, with Charles Reade&mdash;who,
as we all know, was one of the greatest literary
geniuses of his time&mdash;for an ally. I meet young
people to-day who tell me they have never read
this fine novelist's glorious romance, "The Cloister
and the Hearth," and say they "don't think they
should like it." I am truly sorry for them.</p>

<p>Charles Reade, although his works were greedily
snapped up by the publishers, loved the stage, had
great faith in his own plays, and took endless trouble
over their production.</p>

<p>His drama, "The Double Marriage," was taken
from his novel, "White Lies" (which had been suggested
by a French play from the pen of Auguste
Maquet, entitled "Le Chateau de Grantier"), and
it was produced at the Queen's on October 24th,
1867.</p>

<p>It is said that when a quick critic found out the
source of the plot, Charles Reade was very angry,
and it seems difficult to believe that so great a man
should annex another writer's story without acknowledgment.</p>

<p>The cast of "The Double Marriage" was not
only a strong but a very interesting one. Ellen
Terry and Fanny Addison played the heroines;
Alfred Wigan was the hero, Charles Wyndham had
an effective part, and in a smaller one Lionel Brough
made his <i>début</i> on the London stage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>Contrary to all expectation, and in spite of excellent
acting, "The Double Marriage" did not
attract the public. I shall always think that the
play deserved a better fate. Years afterwards, on
a provincial tour, it was revived by Arthur Dacre
and his wife, the well-remembered Amy Roselle.
Poor things! They had great faith in their venture,
and had expended much money on special scenery
and costumes. It was effective enough, and ought
to have been attractive, but "bad luck" once more
attended it, and I fear it was one of the many
disappointments that led to the unfortunate Dacres'
tragic end.</p>

<p>At the Queen's "The Double Marriage" soon
gave way to a revival of Tom Taylor's perennial
"Still Waters Run Deep." In this Ellen Terry
played to admiration the by no means easy character
of Mrs. Mildmay. Alfred Wigan resumed his
original character of the self-contained John Mildmay;
Mrs. Wigan was the Mrs. Sternhold; and
Charles Wyndham (destined to become the best of
all John Mildmays) the Captain Hawkesley. On
December 26th a very interesting event took place.
Garrick's one-act excision from "The Taming of the
Shrew," dubbed "Katherine and Petruchio," was
revived, and in it Ellen Terry played for the first
time with Henry Irving. Critics very much differed
as to the merits of the new "shrew" and her
"tamer," and, indeed, they had not much chance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
in this abridged version of the comedy of displaying
their ability, but in face of later theatrical history
the meeting is noteworthy. It is a matter for regret
that these distinguished artists have not included
"The Taming of the Shrew" in their noble Shakespearean
repertory at the Lyceum. Possibly they
have been deterred by the perfect success made in the
leading characters by their American contemporaries,
Ada Rehan and John Drew. It has remained for
them to show Shakespeare's comedy in all its glory.
In her "Stray Memories," Ellen Terry has thus recorded
the impression made upon her by Henry
Irving in those early days:&mdash;</p>

<p>"From the first," she says, "I noticed that Mr.
Irving worked more concentratedly than all the other
actors put together, and the most important lesson of
my working life I learnt from him, that to do one's
work well one must <i>work continually</i>, live a life of
constant self-denial for that purpose, and, in short,
keep one's nose upon the grindstone. It is a lesson
one had better learn early in stage life, I think, for
the bright, glorious, healthy career of an actor is but
brief at the best."</p>

<p>A very pleasant recollection of these days is Ellen
Terry's appearance with John Clayton in Francis
Talfourd's pretty comedietta, "A Household Fairy,"
which, with Mr. H. T. Craven and Miss Wyndham in
the two parts that form the cast was first produced
at the St. James's Theatre on December 24th, 1859.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
In later years it was admirably performed at the
Globe Theatre, Henry Neville playing Julian de
Clifford, and Lydia Foote, Catherine. But the
sprightly, warm-hearted, and at the same time
serious, "Kitty" of the Queen's added lustre to the
author's meaning, and was, as he intended her to be,
a veritable fairy of the fireside.</p>

<p>But at the close of this brief engagement Ellen
Terry again said <i>au revoir</i> (luckily it was not <i>adieu</i>)
to the stage, and for seven years her gracious presence
was withdrawn from us.</p>

<p>During this period she became the wife of Mr.
Charles Wardell, a gentleman well known to playgoers
as Charles Kelly, the name he adopted when,
retiring from his position as an officer in a first-class
cavalry regiment, he followed his inclinations and took
to the stage. In parts of what may be called a stolid
type Charles Kelly had, in his day, no rival, and his
successes were many. The character of Richard
Arkwright in Tom Taylor's interesting drama, "Arkwright's
Wife," was, probably, his greatest original
achievement; but, as we shall presently see, he did
admirable work in Shakespearean drama as well as in
the modern plays in which his services were highly
esteemed, and always in request. He was also an
excellent comedian. When John Hare first gave his
inimitable performance of Lord Kilclare in "A Quiet
Rubber" at the Court Theatre, the honours were
pretty equally divided between him and Charles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
Kelly, who, as the hasty-tempered but high-minded
Irish gentleman, Mr. Sullivan, gave a masterly sketch
of Hibernian character.</p>

<p>We were all sorry when our well-beloved petrel
once more betook herself to the freedom of the winds
and the waves; but we waited patiently in the
certain hope that she would again return to the shore
fringed by the footlights.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the earliest days of 1874 London theatre lovers
who were not behind the scenes were puzzled as to
who an "eminent actress" could be who, "after a
long period of retirement," was announced to appear
at the Queen's Theatre as the heroine of Charles
Reade's drama, "The Wandering Heir." With Mrs.
John Wood in the character the piece had already
made its mark, but that talented actress was under
contract to appear elsewhere, and horses had to be
swopped in the middle of a stream. Until almost the
last moment the secret of the vague announcement
was well kept, and then to the general joy it was
discovered that the "dark lady" was Ellen Terry.</p>

<p>Of course her admirers rallied round her to a man&mdash;and
woman&mdash;and her difficult task of succeeding an
eminent artiste in a newly created part was not only
fulfilled to perfection but crowned with well won
approbation. There was no false note about the
praise. The "wanderer" was not extolled because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
she was Ellen Terry, but because of the true excellence
of her acting.</p>

<p>The enthusiasm of her reception and the appreciation
of her critics must have warmed her heart and
encouraged her, for she has said that from that time
until the present she has never lost zest for her work.</p>

<p>Of this notable impersonation of Charles Reade's
Philippa Chester (by the way, the play was no doubt
suggested by the famous Tichborne case, which was
then the talk of the hour), the critic of the <i>Daily
Telegraph</i> said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Miss Ellen Terry possesses exactly the qualifications
demanded by such a character as Philippa,
and the undiminished brightness and buoyancy of her
style became at once apparent in the scene when the
hoyden dwells with such delight on her love of boyish
pastimes, yet shows how much she retains of girlish
modesty and simplicity. Hardly less effective when
the action is transferred to America, and Philippa
appears in male attire, was her generous devotion to
the interests of James Annesley&mdash;while the struggle
under masculine garb to veil repeated signs of strong
womanly devotion was most artistically indicated.
Mr. Charles Reade's drama of 'The Wandering Heir,'
which possesses a highly-interesting story wrought
out with remarkable ingenuity, has thus become
endowed with an additional element of attraction, and
the prosperous career of a piece having a peculiar significance
at the present time promises to be prolonged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
far beyond the hundred nights it has already nearly
attained."</p>

<p>When his tenancy of the Queen's Theatre came to
an end, the energetic Charles Reade took his plays
and his loyal little company over Westminster Bridge
to "Astley's," of immortal memory, and there Ellen
Terry distinguished herself not only as Philippa
Chester, but as Susan Merton in the famous "Never
Too Late to Mend," which, admirable as it was in its
volume form, became even more popular when transferred
by its masterly author to the stage. Even
after this lapse of time the stirring drama, teaching
as it does the most useful of lessons, is a good one
to conjure with, and in the provinces, at least, is
always sure to attract its faithful pit and gallery.</p>

<p>Ellen Terry speaks very affectionately of clever
and determined Charles Reade, and cherishes the
memory of the time when she served under his
somewhat formidably waved banner. "Dear, lovable,
aggravating, childlike, crafty, gentle, obstinate, and
entirely delightful and interesting Charles Reade,"
she calls him&mdash;and we may be quite sure that
while she, despite his foibles, understood his great
genius and noble heart, he, in his turn, appreciated
her sweet nature and unlimited talents. Before
taking leave of "The Wandering Heir" I must
make mention of Edmund Leathes, who was the
original James Annesley of the cast. He was a
gifted as well as a graceful actor, he made his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
name as an author, and he vanished from us all
too soon.</p>

<p>From the days of 1874 to these of 1901 Ellen
Terry has always been with us. The carrier-dove
had this time come home for good, and the message
that she has constantly repeated has been ever a
sweet one to those many thousands who, all unknown
to her, not only admire but love her.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="p4">IN TOTTENHAM STREET</p>


<p>In 1875 Mr. and Mrs. Bancroft decided to make a
bold experiment at the old Prince of Wales' Theatre
in Tottenham Street. In that little playhouse which,
thanks to their taste and admirable management,
had become the favourite resort of playgoers far
and near; in the birthplace and home of the sweet
and memorable series of T. W. Robertson's comedies,
they would soar to Shakespeare, and give an elaborate
as well as an artistic production of "The Merchant
of Venice."</p>

<p>As far as the company was concerned the cast
presented few difficulties. Charles F. Coghlan, who
was deservedly regarded as one of the finest and
most powerful actors of his day, was to have his
chance as Shylock, and, since Mrs. Kendal, who
was playing with John Hare at the Court Theatre,
was not available, all that was wanted was an ideal
Portia.</p>

<p>She was found in Ellen Terry, and in some
ways the engagement was the most eventful episode
in her artistic career. April 17th was the night of
the revival, and even those who had illimitable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
faith in the Bancrofts were amazed at the scenic
treat that had been prepared for them. It seemed
incredible that such perfect pictures of Venice, exact
in every detail, and painted and modelled from
drawings specially taken from the beautiful city
of the sea, could be displayed on the small stage.
They charmed the eye and satisfied the mind.
Venice in all its beauty seemed to have transported
some of its loveliest spots to dingy Tottenham Street,
and a convincing colour was given to the performance
such as had not hitherto been seen.</p>

<p>The costumes were equally artistic and appropriate,&mdash;the
parts had been well and very carefully
distributed, the success of the production seemed
assured,&mdash;but in spite of its undeniable, and in many
respects unequalled, excellences, it proved unattractive,
and had to be speedily withdrawn.</p>

<p>The disappointment centred itself, where it had
been least expected, in Charles Coghlan's Shylock,
and "The Merchant of Venice," without a strongly
appreciative and audience satisfying Jew of Venice
is doomed to collapse. It was in this way that the
beautifully painted and firmly built house of cards
tumbled down. It was, and is, inexplicable. Charles
Coghlan had over and over again proved himself to
be the best of actors. Critics, aware of his latent
power, had thought him thrown away on the comparatively
trivial parts he had been called upon to
play, and felt certain that when he could "let himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
go," he would electrify. The power was there&mdash;in
after years it made itself manifest; but, for some
strange reason, it lay dormant in his Shylock&mdash;or at
any rate in his Shylock of 1875. There was no lapse
of memory on the actor's part&mdash;no physical breakdown.
The character had evidently been most carefully
studied, and the delivery of Shakespeare's lines
left little or nothing to be desired. Apparently the
actor had made the fatal mistake of thinking that
Shylock was one of those strong parts that would&mdash;in
theatrical parlance&mdash;"play itself." He was
utterly wrong. If Shylock does not reveal himself
in his distinctly true colours, not even the ideal
Portia can prevent his fading from the picture, and
leaving Shakespeare's canvas a blank.</p>

<p>David Garrick's contemporary, Charles Macklin,
whose name will ever live as the first appreciative
impersonator of this superbly drawn character&mdash;as
full of light as it is of shade&mdash;said of his first appearance
in it, and when he had from the outset found his
audience in sympathy with him:&mdash;</p>

<p>"These encomiums warmed but did not overset me.
I knew where I should have the pull, which was in
the third act, and reserved myself accordingly. At
this period I threw out all my fire; and as the contrasted
passions of joy for the merchant's losses and
grief for the elopement of Jessica, open a fine field for
an actor's powers, I had the good fortune to please
beyond my wildest expectations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>"The whole house was in an uproar of applause.
The trial scene wound up the fulness of my reputation;
here I was well listened to; and here I made
such a silent yet forcible impression upon the audience
that I retired from this great attempt well satisfied.</p>

<p>"On my return to the green-room after the play
was over, it was crowded with nobility and critics,
who all complimented me in the warmest and most
unbounded manner; and the situation I found myself
in, I must confess, was one of the most flattering and
intoxicating in my whole life.</p>

<p>"No money, no title, could purchase what I felt.
And let no man tell me after this what fame will not
inspire a man to do, and how far the attainment of it
will not remunerate his greatest labours. By Heaven,
sir, though I was not worth fifty pounds in the world
at the time, yet let me tell you that I was Charles
the Great for that night."</p>

<p>Soon after this success Macklin received an invitation
to dine with Bolingbroke and Pope at Battersea.
The latter's couplet on his performance&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"This is the Jew</div>
  <div class="i0">That Shakespeare drew,"</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>is well known, and the nineteenth night of the run
being his benefit, Bolingbroke sent him a purse containing
twenty guineas, such a present being then
considered a compliment.</p>

<p>On April 17, 1875, poor Charles Coghlan was
anything but Charles the Great. Always careful in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
the details of his make-up, he was a picturesque figure,
but his expectant audience waited in vain for the
effect that should have been made by the "pull" in
the third act&mdash;for the fire that was never thrown out&mdash;and
for the forcible impression of the trial scene.
The "nobility and critics" were in front, but they
could not compliment the new Shylock, and had sadly
to admit that he was anything but the Jew that
Shakespeare drew.</p>

<p>Charles Coghlan seemed for the moment to have
forgotten that Shakespeare meant his matchless text
to be illuminated by the actor. He ought to have
borne in mind Mrs. Micawber's adage: "Things
cannot turn up of themselves. We must in a measure
assist them to turn up."</p>

<p>No doubt his grave and unaccountable mistake
killed the production, and from it the Bancrofts must
have suffered not only bitter disappointment, but
heavy pecuniary loss. It is pleasant to remember
how in their published records they very lightly
touch upon the shortcomings of their stage comrade.
But the Bancrofts were ever kindly and generous,
and in every way merit the honours that have been
conferred upon them. Were they not the pioneers
of a new, tasteful, and pure departure in English
dramatic art? Is it not to them that we owe the
evergreen comedies of Robertson and the refined
theatrical school that he founded?</p>

<p>It is wonderful that thus heavily handicapped
with an insipid Shylock the Portia of the evening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
made a never-to-be-forgotten triumph. But triumph
she did, and all along the line. It at once became
apparent that we had amongst us an actress who
could play the heroines of Shakespeare in a manner
that would vie with her great predecessors in the
parts, and that she would endow them with new
graces and sweet fancies of her own. Such an actress
was sorely needed, and we were grateful for her
timely advent.</p>

<p>Well did Joseph Knight say of Ellen Terry and
that famous night at the pleasant little theatre in
Tottenham Street, "She had revealed the gifts which
are the rarest on the English stage."</p>

<p>Continuing, he wrote: "More adequate expression
has seldom been given to the light-heartedness of
maidenhood, the perplexities and hesitations of love,
and the inevitable content of gratified aspirations
and ambitions. Not less successful were the scenes
of badinage. Portia's address before the court was
excellent, and the famous speech on mercy assumed
new beauties from a correct and exquisite delivery.
A very noteworthy point in the performance was the
womanly interest in Shylock&mdash;the endeavour to win
him, for his own sake, from the pursuit of his grim
resolve. The delivery of the lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"'Shylock, there's thrice thy money offered thee,'</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>and</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"'Have by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge</div>
  <div class="i0">To stop his wounds, lest he do bleed to death,'</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>were dictated by sublime compassion."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>In accord with this was the opinion of Dutton
Cook, who wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p>"With all the charms of aspect and graces of
manner indispensable to the impersonation of the
heiress of Belmont, Miss Terry is gifted with a voice
of silvery and sympathetic tone, while her elocutionary
method should be prized by her fellow actors.
Portia has been presented now with tragedy queen
airs, and now with vivacity of the soubrette sort&mdash;as
when in Garrick's time Mrs. Clive played the part,
and made a point of mimicking the more famous
barristers of her time; indeed, a nice combination of
stateliness, animation, sentiment, archness, poetry,
tenderness, and humour is required of the actress
entrusted with the character. Miss Terry's Portia
leaves little to be desired; she is singularly skilled
in the business of the scene, and assists the action
of the drama by great care and inventiveness with
regard to details. There is something of passion in
the anxiety with which she watches Bassanio's choice
of the leaden casket; while the confession of her love
which follows upon that incident is delivered with a
depth of feeling such as only a mistress of her art
could accomplish."</p>

<p>And so it was with all the critics. Probably
there never was an occasion on which they were so
unanimous. In the presence of true genius we must
all agree.</p>

<p>How difficult it is to define the word "genius."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
To my mind it has never been so well done as by
George William Curtis, who said&mdash;</p>

<p>"The secret of the rose's sweetness, of the bird's
ecstasy, of the sunset's glory, that is the secret of
genius."</p>

<p>Certainly this seems to sum up the genius of
Ellen Terry.</p>

<p>Since that night when she first played Portia, it
has never lost its hold upon the public, or its influence
upon our stage. With an equally magnetic Shylock
the Bancrofts' brave venture with "The Merchant of
Venice" would surely have run for many months, and
in view of the deep impression she has made, it must
have been a great disappointment to Ellen Terry that
this was not to be. She did not know then that both
in England and America her Portia would prove an
ever-recurring joy. It was ordained that as Ophelia
she should commence her long and brilliant series of
Shakespearean impersonations with Henry Irving at
the Lyceum, but it was as Portia at the Bancrofts'
Prince of Wales' Theatre that she first won all our
hearts, from the scholarly critic of our greatest poet,
to those who only regard "The Merchant of Venice" as
an interesting play that they pay their money to see.
Portia will, I think, ever sparkle as the brightest
gem in her well bejewelled crown.</p>

<p>Being human, Ellen Terry must have felt somewhat
chagrined that the fiasco of Charles Coghlan's
Shylock should, for a time, banish her Portia, and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
is characteristic of her generous nature that a few
months later she should be playing, for a single performance,
Pauline Deschappelles to his Claude Melnotte
at the Princess's Theatre. It was one of those
ephemeral stage experiments that could lead to no
immediate good. It involved much study, great
anxiety, and hard work. Probably in undertaking
the task Ellen Terry was actuated by the unselfish
desire to help to reinstate her old comrade of the
Bristol days in the public estimation. I know that
in the long period of her unalterably established fame
she has ever been the first to help a fellow actor
fallen by the way. If this was her desire she succeeded
beyond her expectations. As Claude Melnotte
Coghlan did much to redeem his recent
unfortunate venture, and as Pauline she evoked
pæans of praise. Writing of this performance Joseph
Knight said that its effect was to set the seal upon
a growing reputation, and to make evident the fact
that an actress of a high, if not the highest, order
had arisen in our midst. He felt, as every one felt,
that in Ellen Terry an artist had developed in whom
there was that perception of analogies, that insight
into mysteries, and that power of interpretation on
which the world has bestowed the name of genius.
"Circumstances," he truly remarked, "took Miss
Terry from the stage at a time when men dimly
perceived in her the promise which has since been
realised. It is probable that some delay in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
maturity of style indispensable to perfection in histrionic
art has resulted from this break in her career.
The interval can scarcely have been misspent, however,
since Miss Terry reappeared on the stage with
ripened powers and with improved methods."</p>

<p>In saying that her presentation of Pauline "comprised
a series of pictures each more graceful than
the preceding," he echoed the general opinion; but
I do not think that the great mass of enthusiastic
playgoers could be with him when he added that
they were "all too good for the lackadaisical play
in which she appeared."</p>

<p>Poor "Lady of Lyons"! There are still a little
band of your faithful admirers who hate to hear you
condemned as you are to-day, as tawdry, cheap, and
artificial. They look back fondly on happy and
soul-stirring hours spent with you in the past; they
know that you can still hold intelligent, if somewhat
sentimentally inclined, audiences spellbound; and
they believe that if any later-day dramatist could
write a play containing as good a character for a
stage heroine, he would reap a fortune. But among
the superfine, my sweet "Lady of Lyons," you
are condemned as "old-fashioned," and your loyal
followers, if they open their lips in your praise, must
be content to share the same ridicule and fate. It is
very terrible to be old-fashioned; but I, for one, shall
be true to you as long as I live. In the course of his
criticism the writer said, "It is too early yet to gauge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
fully the talent which has revealed itself. It seems
probable that Miss Terry's powers will be restrained
to depicting the grace, tenderness, and passion of
love. In the short scene in the third act, in which
Pauline chides her lover for treachery, the actress
scarcely rose to the requisite indignation. Limiting,
however, what is to be hoped for her within the
bounds indicated, what chance is there not afforded?
Juliet, in the stronger scenes, would be, we should
fancy, outside the physical resources of the artist.
Beatrice, Rosalind, Viola, Imogen, Miranda, and a
score of other characters of the most delicate and
fragrant beauty, are, however, all within what appears
to be her range. In the present state of public feeling
respecting the Shakespearean drama, it will be
strange indeed if some manager does not take the
opportunity of mounting some of those plays for
which her talent is so eminently adapted. The period
during which an actress can play such parts with
effect is brief; and a portion of Miss Terry's career
has already been lost so far as the stage is concerned.
There will be regrettable waste if talent, so specially
suited to the Shakespearean drama, is confined to
Lord Lytton's facile sentiment and sparkling rhetoric."</p>

<p>Do not heed these final words, dear "Lady of
Lyons." Believe me, there are still many hundreds
of gardeners' sons, Princes of Coma, and Colonel
Moiriers, ready to be your lovers, and worship at
your feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>Twenty-six fruitful years have elapsed since the
foregoing criticism was written, and we can be wise
after the event. Joseph Knight has proved himself
to be a good prophet, but by the light of to-day
we know that he might have added to his list of
Shakespearean characters within Ellen Terry's range.
To the regret of all, we have not yet seen her Rosalind
and Miranda, but she has triumphed as Viola and
Imogen, and (though she did not satisfy every one in
the part) has proved that her physical and artistic
resources were equal to the portrayal of the passion
and sorrow of Juliet. She has shone as Beatrice,
Cordelia, Desdemona, Lady Anne, and Ophelia; she
has astonished us and excited our admiration as
Queen Katherine and Lady Macbeth, and has even
made a great personal success as the determined
Volumnia. Add to these the Mamillius, Puck, Prince
Arthur, Katherine, and other parts of earlier days,
and we see what a Shakespearean record has been
made.</p>

<p>During her engagement at the Prince of Wales'
Theatre, she also appeared as Clara Douglas in Lord
Lytton's comedy, "Money"; as Mabel Vane in
Charles Reade's and Tom Taylor's "Masks and Faces";
and as Blanche Haye in one of the many revivals
of T. W. Robertson's "Ours." In each of these
characters her peculiar grace and distinction, coupled
with tenderness, were apparent, but none of them
offered her a chance worthy of her now fully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
recognised power. In H. J. Byron's comedy,
"Wrinkles; or, A Tale of Time," she was doomed
to disappointment. Byron, as a writer for the stage,
was then in the zenith of his fame. Everywhere his
comedies and burlesques were in demand, and it was
only natural that he should receive a commission for
a play from his old friends the Bancrofts. Writing
for the best comedy company in London, and with
Ellen Terry, the idol of the hour, designed for his
heroine, he no doubt intended to produce his masterpiece;
but, somehow, "Wrinkles" failed. Indeed,
on the first night, failure was in the air. Not only
did the piece prove unattractive in itself, but (a most
unusual thing for any play directed by the Bancrofts)
it seemed hardly ready for production. Hereby hangs
a characteristic story of poor Byron. At the end of
the third act ("Wrinkles" possessed four), though
no open hostility had been displayed, his dramatic instinct
told him that his work was doomed. Inwardly
suffering the torments of the defeated playwright,
but outwardly putting on a brave show of <i>nonchalance</i>,
he lounged about the front of the house. The long
waits between the acts had already been a source
of dissatisfaction, and now had come the weariest
interval of all. Added to this, sounds were heard
behind the act-drop as of a carpenter sawing wood,
suggesting&mdash;ominously suggesting&mdash;that the scenery
was defective. "What on earth are they doing,
Byron?" asked a friend. The poor author was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
gloomy and dejected, but, even at his own expense,
he could never resist a joke. "I don't know," he said,
"but <em>I hope they're cutting out the last act</em>!"</p>

<p>The last act was not cut out, but it did not save
the already foundering play, and the part in which
Ellen Terry had been intended to shine (she did not
appear in it) flickered out.</p>

<p>But her engagement in Tottenham Street will ever
be remembered by her first appearance as Portia, and
to the Bancrofts we owe her introduction to one of
her greatest parts.</p>

<p>"How I loved playing Portia," she has said. "I
have tried five or six different ways of treating her.
Unfortunately, the way I think the <i>best</i> way does not
find response with my audiences."</p>

<p>Be that as it may, she continues to play Portia in
a way that her critics as well as friends deem the
best, and assuredly it requires no alteration. May
she thus go on playing it for many a year to come!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="p4">IN SLOANE SQUARE</p>


<p>At this time the Bancrofts' old and well loved
comrade, John Hare, was acting and managing in
friendly rivalry with them at the original Court
Theatre in Sloane Square. In 1876, the Kendals,
having concluded a most prosperous season with him,
left to fulfil an engagement in Tottenham Street,
and he secured the services of Ellen Terry, whose
husband, Charles Kelly, was already serving under
his banner.</p>

<p>Before he went to fulfil his first engagement in
America, John Hare entrusted me with the task of
writing his biography, and, apart from my own observations
of them, I became very well acquainted with
the history of the series of plays in which Ellen Terry
appeared in the dainty Chelsea playhouse.</p>

<p>Her first venture in her new home was as Kate
Hungerford, in an original comedy by Charles Coghlan,
entitled "Brothers," of which great things were expected.
The cast included John Hare, Charles Kelly,
H. B. Conway (one of the handsomest young actors
of his day), G. W. Anson (a born comedian), Miss
Bessie Hollingshead (the pretty and gifted daughter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
of the valiant and erudite John Hollingshead), and
the always delightful Mrs. Gaston Murray. It was a
cleverly written play, and the acting had the <i>ensemble</i>
that John Hare had striven so hard and so successfully
to impart, but it did not "draw the town," and
it was very speedily succeeded by a revival of Tom
Taylor and A. W. Dubourg's charming comedy, "New
Men and Old Acres," in which Ellen Terry played
the part created by Mrs. Kendal on the original production
of the piece at the Haymarket Theatre, and
Hare followed Chippendale as Vavasour. By all
concerned this was so beautifully performed, and by
the indefatigable actor-manager so perfectly stage-managed,
that solid and lasting success was assured.
The good work that was being done was generously
as well as generally recognised, and the critical
<i>Athenæum</i> spoke for the public when it said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Without going to the best Parisian theatres, it
is not easy to rival the performance now given, and
there even the majority of the impersonations would
call for notice. The result is highly gratifying to the
public, unused to spectacles such as are now presented
to it, and is most honourable to the management....
We may congratulate accordingly Mr. Hare and his
company upon a performance that lifts off a portion
of the reproach under which we have lain, and that is
the more noteworthy inasmuch as of the dozen actors
concerned in the performance, there is no one that
does not deserve praise."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>The character of Lilian Vavasour had been so
inseparably associated with the name of Mrs. Kendal,
who when she first appeared in it was still using her
maiden name (well loved by the public) of Madge
Robertson, that it must have been difficult for Ellen
Terry to take it up, as it were, at second-hand. That
she succeeded in it to admiration, and once more
secured a long run for the pretty comedy, speaks
volumes for her talent and personal charm. I suppose
nowadays "New Men and Old Acres" would be
called "old-fashioned." Many of us would like to
see it again as played by those dozen actors who all
"deserved praise."</p>

<p>Early in 1877 it was apparent that Henry Compton,
the veteran Haymarket comedian, whose name
will ever rank with the greatest of his art, would be
unable to return to the active work of the stage.
By his professional brothers and sisters he was both
loved and respected, and they resolved to give evidence
to their sympathy by organising a history-making
benefit performance.</p>

<p>This was given at Drury Lane Theatre on March 1.
The substantial item on the bill of fare was Lord
Lytton's "Money," with a cast that included the
well-known names of Henry Neville, John Hare,
W. H. Kendal, Benjamin Webster (he emerged from his
retirement to play his original character of Graves,
and it was his last appearance on the stage), David
James, and Squire Bancroft. Mrs. Bancroft played<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
Lady Franklin; Mrs. Kendal, Clara Douglas; and
Ellen Terry, Georgina Vesey.</p>

<p>All concerned in this undertaking were anxious to
do honour to the name of Henry Compton, and the
happy thought was conceived of inviting his son,
Edward Compton, then a young fellow "serving his
time" with the provincial stock companies, to play the
central part of Alfred Evelyn. It was a nervous first
appearance in London for so youthful and inexperienced
an actor, but he performed his task bravely,
and delighted his worthy father as well as his
audience. He has often told me of the kindly encouragement
he received from the great artists by
whom he so unexpectedly found himself surrounded.
Since then, as the founder and indefatigable manager
of the Compton Comedy Company, he has helped
many excellent actors and actresses to reach the
coveted London boards.</p>

<p>As a motto to "Money," the following cynical
lines are often used&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"It's a very good world that we live in,</div>
  <div class="i0">To lend, or to spend, or to give in,</div>
  <div class="i0">But to beg, or to borrow, or get what's your own,</div>
  <div class="i0">It's the very worst world that ever was known."</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the little world of the theatre lending and
giving ungrudgingly goes on; the worthy, unfortunate,
and unasking beggar is (to put him in that
light) charitably treated; and one will cheerily help
another to obtain his own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>Until October 1877, "New Men and Old Acres"
pursued its prosperous course, and by that time John
Hare was ready with one of his most ambitious
efforts.</p>

<p>This was the production of Lord Lytton's posthumous
work, "The House of Darnley," and concerning
it I cannot do better than quote Dutton Cook, when
he said: "A critic wrote concisely of the late Lord
Lytton's play of 'Not so Bad as we Seem' that it
was 'not so good as we expected.' Perhaps a like
judgment might fairly be passed upon the noble
author's posthumous comedy, 'The House of Darnley.'
It was inevitable, however, that Lord Lytton's fame
should stimulate hope unduly. The author of 'The
Lady of Lyons' and 'Money' may reasonably be
reckoned the most successful dramatist" (let it be
remembered that this was written in 1877) "of the
nineteenth century. It may be said at once that with
those established works the new comedy cannot afford
comparison. But in estimating the worth of 'The
House of Darnley' it is very necessary to bear in
mind the peculiar conditions under which it is submitted
to the public. The play was left in an unfinished
state; the whole of the last act has been
furnished by Mr. Coghlan, who was without other
clue than his fancy could suggest as to the original
design of the dramatist. More than any other
literary work, a drama must benefit by revision and
reconsideration on the part of the author; in such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
wise weak points in construction may be strengthened,
gaps in the story supplied, the dialogue braced, and
the action quickened."</p>

<p>That in the face of all these very properly pointed
out difficulties success should have been won, speaks
volumes for the tact of the courageous manager, and
the skill of his fellow-workers.</p>

<p>Let me again quote my authority:&mdash;</p>

<p>"With all its defects," he says, "'The House of
Darnley' secures the attention and the respect of
the audience, and succeeds in right of its own good
qualities, and not merely because of the esteem in
which the performances of its departed author are
generally held. If the theme be weak, it is yet
strongly handled, and demonstrates sufficiently the
wit and the humour and the literary accomplishments
of the late Lord Lytton. The comedy has
been provided for with the good taste and liberality
which have so laudably distinguished Mr. Hare's
management."</p>

<p>Ellen Terry acted with great distinction as Lady
Juliet, and excellent work was done by John Hare,
Charles Kelly, Alfred Bishop, Amy Roselle, and others,
but, interesting though it was, the play did not long
hold the stage.</p>

<p>There was another performance in 1877 that must
not be forgotten. This was on June 20th, at the
Gaiety Theatre, for the benefit of Charles Lamb
Kenney, who had through illness lasting over a considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
time been unable to ply his facile pen.
"The School for Scandal" was the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pièce de résistance</i>,
and it was then that Ellen Terry appeared for the
first time as Lady Teazle. Charles Kelly was the
Sir Peter; Henry Neville, Charles Surface; and John
Clayton, Joseph Surface. By those who remember
the prodigiously long run of Sheridan's masterpiece
at the Vaudeville Theatre, the last mentioned performances
of the admirably contrasted brothers will
ever be borne in appreciative memory. Mrs. Arthur
Stirling was the Mrs. Candour; and Mrs. Alfred
Mellon the Lady Sneerwell. As may be imagined
Ellen Terry played Lady Teazle with winsome high
spirits in the earlier acts, and plaintive remorse in
the great screen scene.</p>

<p>John Hare's next venture at the Court Theatre
was not successful. In spite of the care lavished
upon its production, and of much clever acting on the
part of the company, Tom Taylor's comedy "Victims,"
originally presented at the Haymarket in 1857, failed
to attract audiences in 1878, and was speedily withdrawn.
Withdrawn, it may be unhesitatingly said, in
favour of his greatest managerial success&mdash;the stage
version by W. G. Wills of Oliver Goldsmith's immortal
story "The Vicar of Wakefield," entitled
"Olivia." John Hare suggested the subject to Wills,
and it was at once seized with the characteristic
avidity of a prolific and graceful writer. No one who
knew that unquestionable, but all too kindly and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
erratic, genius will be surprised to hear that the first
draft of the play was for stage purposes impossible.
It was made up of scenes of great beauty hopelessly
choked with vast quantities of irrelevant matter. It
was not consecutively written, but was jotted down at
random in untidy copy-books, on the backs of used
envelopes, chance scraps of paper, and even on the
eager but unmethodical author's wristbands. At one
time the task of bringing all this heterogeneous
matter into workmanlike form seemed to be a hopeless
one, but with full faith in his project and his
author, John Hare was not to be baffled.</p>

<p>Night after night the two sat up together, and the
play was re-constructed and re-written in accordance
with the practical managerial views. When it was
at last completed the dramatist prudently withdrew
from the scene. W. G. Wills had no interest in or
talent for stage management, and he wisely left the
production in the experienced hands of John Hare,
only attending the perfected rehearsal on the eve of
the first performance.</p>

<p>John Hare can rarely be induced to talk about
himself or his work, but in connection with this production
he is inclined to be somewhat enthusiastic.
"The beauty of the subject," he told me, "made the
stage management of this play profoundly interesting
to me, and stimulated my imagination and inventive
powers to a greater height than I had ever reached.
By working out the whole scheme of the play in my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
home study I planned all the movements and minute
stage directions, so that at the very first rehearsal it
practically was the same as when it was presented to
the public. The part of the Vicar I offered in the
first instance to Alfred Wigan, making every effort to
induce him to return to the stage in order that he
might create this beautiful character. I could not
induce him, however, to face the footlights again. So
Hermann Vezin became the 'Court' Vicar, and how
admirably he played the part we all know."</p>

<p>No one grudges Hermann Vezin his well-won
success in the part, but some of us who ponder
over things theatrical, sometimes wonder whether,
if the Court Theatre had had another manager,
and the services of John Hare had been available,
he might not have been induced to impersonate
Dr. Primrose.</p>

<p>The part of Olivia had of course been designed for
Ellen Terry, and how much she was pleased with it is
proved by the following little note impulsively dashed
off to the author:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">"<span class="smcap">Court Theatre</span>,<br />
<i>Monday, March 5, 1878</i>.</p>

<blockquote><p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Wills</span>,&mdash;I can't tell you how <i>much</i> I
was delighted with the play, and with my part, but I
<i>was</i> delighted!</p>

<p>"I only hope I shall be able to please you in my
part of the work.&mdash;Believe me to be, very sincerely
yours, <span style="margin-left: 5em;"><span class="smcap">Ellen Terry</span>."</span></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>Indeed, she always liked to study the words of this
author. At the Lyceum, in addition to the repetition
of Olivia, she played his Queen Henrietta Maria in the
revivals of "Charles I."; his Ruth Meadows in "The
Fate of Eugene Aram," and his Margaret in "Faust."</p>

<p>Concerning "Charles I.," she wrote to him (this
letter was published by Mr. Freeman Wills in his
highly interesting memoir of his brother):&mdash;</p>

<p>"I'm just returned from our last rehearsal of
'Charles I.,' and, coming home in my carriage, have
been reading the last act, and I can't help writing to
thank you and bless you for having written those
<i>five last pages</i>. Never, <i>never</i> has anything more
beautiful been written in English&mdash;I know no other
language. They are perfection; and I&mdash;often as
I've acted with Henry Irving in the play&mdash;am <i>all
melted</i> at reading it again. An immortality for you
for this alone."</p>

<p>She greatly grieved over her well-loved author's
death, and concerning it wrote to her friend, Alfred
C. Calmour:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">"<span class="smcap">22 Barkston Gardens, Earl's Court, S.W.</span>,<br />
<i>December 15, 1891</i>.</p>

<blockquote><p>"Thank you for writing. Wretched news, is it
not? A genius and a dear fellow. I know how
much you will miss him, and I'm very sorry for you
and for myself too.</p>

<p>"I hope he was conscious and had folk he cared
for by him.&mdash;Yours ever, <span style="margin-left: 5em;"><span class="smcap">Ellen Terry.</span>"</span></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>She is indeed the most charming of letter writers,
and, if it were permissible, it would be pleasant to fill
a chapter with her lively, as well as sympathetic,
correspondence with the famous men and women of
her day; but she very strongly, as well as very
rightly, holds the opinion that to publish private
letters intended for one person only is like asking an
audience to put their ears to a keyhole and listen to
a private conversation.</p>

<p>But to return to "Olivia." The beautiful play was
produced at the Court Theatre on 30th March 1878,
and at once won its well deserved victory. The first-night
audience having watched the course of the
story with that breathless silence which is the highest
form of applause, having been over and over again
moved to tears, became, at the fall of the curtain, a
demonstrative one, and the unrestrained enthusiasm
of the plaudits could be heard without Sloane Square.
The critics were in their appreciation and praises
as loud as the audience, and Ellen Terry's triumph
was complete. She was the idolised heroine of a
memorable evening.</p>

<p>"Mr. Wills," said Dutton Cook, "has been
fortunate not merely in his performers, but also in
his manager. Mr. Hare demonstrated anew that he
has elevated theatrical decoration to the rank of a
fine art; indeed, his painstaking and outlay in placing
the play upon the stage justify suspicion that it was
produced almost as much for its pictorial as for its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
dramatic merits. In either case, advantage has been
taken of the opportunity to present a special reflection
of the artistic aspects of the last century with regard
to furniture and costumes, china and glass, &amp;c. A
sort of devout care has been expended upon the
veriest minutiæ of upholstery and ironmongery; a
fond ingenuity is apparent in every direction of the
scene; and the foibles and fancies of those who love,
or imagine that they love, cuckoo clocks, brass
fenders, carved oak, blue and white crockery, and
such matters, have been very liberally considered and
catered for. Prettier pictures have not, indeed, been
seen upon the stage than are afforded by the Primrose
family, their friends and neighbours, goods and
chattels, and general surroundings in this play of
'Olivia.'</p>

<p>"But a higher claim to distinction arises from the
method of its representation. In the hands of Miss
Ellen Terry, Olivia becomes a character of rare
dramatic value, more nearly allied, perhaps, to the
Clarissa of Richardson than to the heroine of Goldsmith.
The actress's singular command of pathetic
expression obtains further manifestation. The scene
of Olivia's farewell to her family, all unconscious
of the impending blow her flight is to inflict
upon them, is curiously affecting in its subtle and
subdued tenderness; while her indignation and remorse
upon discovering the perfidy of Thornhill are
rendered with a vehemence of emotion and tragic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
passion, such as the modern theatre has seldom
exhibited.</p>

<p>"Only an artist of distinct genius could have
ventured upon the impulsive abrupt movement by
means of which she thrusts from her the villain who
has betrayed her, and denotes the intensity of her
scorn of him, the completeness of her change from
loving to loathing.</p>

<p>"Miss Terry is not less successful in the quieter
passages of the drama, while her graces of aspect and
manner enable her to appear as Olivia even to the
full satisfaction of those most prepossessed concerning
the personal charms of that heroine&mdash;so beloved
of painters and illustrators&mdash;to whom have been
dedicated so many acres of canvas, so many square
feet of boxwood."</p>

<p>This criticism well sums up the general opinion.
Joseph Knight was equally full of praise, and said:
"Miss Terry was altogether life-like as Olivia, and
much of her business was extremely natural and
touching. It was full of suggestion, and, in one point
at least, when she repelled the further advances of
the man who had wronged her, it touched absolute
greatness."</p>

<p>Clement Scott pays his tribute as follows:&mdash;"'Olivia,'
as I first saw it at the Court Theatre, is a
memory that will never die while life lasts. It is
one of the most precious souvenirs in my collection....
Words fail to convey an adequate impression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
of the original Olivia&mdash;the spoiled child and darling
of the English home as portrayed by Ellen Terry. I
see the idol of her old father's heart. Vividly and
clearly is presented to my memory the scene where
Olivia, under the hypnotic influence of love, bids
farewell to her loved ones, scattering around her little
treasures, and that 'white face at the window,' when
'Livy' is on the high road to destruction. All that
was pathetic enough; but the dramatic effect was
bound to follow, and it came with vivid truth in the
great scene between Ellen Terry and William Terriss.
At that time, both actor and actress were perfect
specimens of manly beauty and feminine grace.
Terriss was just the dare-devil, defiant creature,
handsome to a fault, that women like Olivia love.
He looked superb in his fine clothes, and his very
insolence was fascinating and attractive.</p>

<p>"When Olivia struck Squire Thornhill in her
distraction and impotent rage, an audible shudder
went through the audience. It was all so unexpected.
But the truth of it was shown by the prolonged and
audible 'Oh!' that accompanied it. When we talk
of the Ellen Terry manner, and her indescribable
charm, may I ask, were they ever better shown than
in the scene where Olivia kisses the holly from the
hedge at home, and then hangs it on a chair and
dances round it with childish delight? And so it
went on from perfection to perfection. For me there
will only be one Olivia&mdash;Ellen Terry."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>No wonder that this fascinating Olivia became
the rage of the day. Her photographs went like
wildfire; the milliners' windows were full of Olivia
hats, caps, 'kerchiefs, and other items of feminine
adornment; everywhere such dainty trifles were in
evidence; and how many little "Olivias" were
christened in 1878 it would be hard to say.</p>

<p>Among the pretty schoolgirls who figured in the
play a young aspirant for dramatic honours made her
first appearance on the stage. This was Kate Rorke.
How highly Ellen Terry thought of her sister artist's
talents will be seen in the course of these pages.
She has ever been ready to recognise merit in her
fellow-workers&mdash;ever willing to render them a
helping hand.</p>

<p>Ellen Terry has modestly declared that it was
because of her popularity as Olivia that Henry
Irving invited her to be his helpmate in his great
projects for his management of the Lyceum Theatre.
It was not only this: many things pointed to the
fact that she was destined to be the greatest
Shakespearean actress of the latter years of the
nineteenth century.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="p4">SOME SPLENDID STROLLING</p>


<p>In the early autumn of 1878, before entering upon
her all-important Lyceum engagement, Ellen Terry,
accompanied by her husband, appeared in some of
our leading provincial cities. Everywhere they were
most warmly welcomed, and the experiment proved
so successful that, even after her Lyceum duties
seemed sufficient to engross all her time and attention,
it was, during a period extending over two
years, repeated.</p>

<p>That was a splendid time for the so-called
"country" playgoer. I well recall how within one
week at the Theatre Royal, Birmingham (this was
in 1879), I saw Ellen Terry in her matchless rendering
of Portia in "The Merchant of Venice," as
Ophelia in "Hamlet," as Lady Teazle in the "School
for Scandal," and as Lilian in "New Men and Old
Acres." I would gladly live that week over again.
In Shakespearean characters Charles Kelly was not,
I think, seen at his best, but in his comedy parts
he was admirable, and there is always an interest
in seeing husband and wife act together. Actors and
actresses love playing to ardent and sympathetic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
provincial audiences. Their absolutely unrestrained
appreciation and applause delight them. The intent
faces and eager ears, bent on losing neither a movement
of the expression nor an inflection of the voice,
act as a tonic to them; there is magnetism between
the stage and the house, and under such conditions
acting is sure to be at its best. There is nothing
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">blasé</i> about the provincial playgoer. He pays for a
play that he wants to see, and if he is pleased he
expresses his gratitude in no uncertain terms. If
he is disappointed he goes sadly and quietly away,
but he is never rude to those who have done their
best to entertain him. "Boos" and author-baiting
are happily unknown in the provinces, and no doubt
this is why actors of eminence are fond of exploiting
new plays in the country before exposing them to
the exasperating risks of a London first night. It
seems astounding that people should exist who can
wantonly deride the failure of anxious authors and
actors, who, having honestly sought to conquer, are
miserably conscious of their own defeat. No play
can be depended upon until it has gone through the
ordeal of a public performance. If the piece that has
read well and rehearsed well fails to grip the public,
the sensitive actors and author are the first to feel
it, and surely in their keen disappointment they
should be spared the humiliation of rowdyism.</p>

<p>Not long ago there was a discussion as to the
"rights" of first-night audiences to "boo" a new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
play and the performers in it. The views of leading
actors and dramatists were sought, and Ellen Terry
replied as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I so entirely believe in the verdict of the great
public that I long to have the first night of a new
play over and done with, for it is, to my mind, the
second night which tells me of the future good or
bad fortune of the play and of our efforts. On the
first night there are one's friends, so many so prejudiced;
and one's enemies&mdash;not so many, but equally
prejudiced, and so it seems to me that the first night
scarcely counts. Then comes the second night, and
all the nights. I can't tell how much it affects me&mdash;moves
me&mdash;the enthusiasm, the attention, the encouragement.
I just adore the public, and the public
loves me back again. I know it, feel it, and am
grateful for it. It refreshes my heart."</p>

<p class="center">"<span class="smcap">Ellen Terry.</span>"</p></blockquote>

<p>This is very prettily put, and it is all very true,
but such a universal favourite is hardly a judge with
regard to the feelings of her less loved sisters who
are subject to the baseness and vulgarity of a detestable
faction of first-nighters.</p>

<p>I may be told that provincial audiences can be
very noisy, and even unruly, and it must be admitted
that the gallery "gods," when packed together
like dried figs in a wooden drum, are apt to be unpleasantly
emphatic concerning their discomfort; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
their objections are raised against each other, and
rarely refer to the stage. Moreover, when anything
really good or impressive is offered to them they
will at once forget their grievances and become as
quiet as mice.</p>

<p>As an instance of this, I recall an evening at the
Prince of Wales' Theatre, Birmingham, when Henry
Irving was announced to appear as Shylock. It had
been raining hard all day, and the streets were filthy
with hopeless slush. As the evening drew in the
torrents descended pitilessly, but in spite of them
great crowds of the faithful had assembled before
the doors of the pit and gallery hours earlier than
they would be opened to them. Long before curtain-rise
the house was uncomfortably crowded. Outside
it was wet and muggy. Inside it was oppressively
close, and the hot atmosphere was redolent with the
odour of saturated clothing and sodden shoe leather.
Ill-temper was in the air, and at the commencement
of the play the actors were greatly troubled by the
noisy quarrels that arose among playgoers ill bestowed.
Then Henry Irving made his striking entrance,
and, instantaneously, all was silent. As if
by magic, he, aided by Ellen Terry as Portia, held
his audience as in a vice, and continued to do so
until the end of the performance. The only sounds
heard in the theatre were those of boisterous applause
and ejaculations of half suppressed gratification
and emotion. It was a great tribute to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
power exercised by the true acting of a masterpiece.</p>

<p>Ellen Terry must ever bear in fond memory those
splendid strolling days when the hearts of her sturdy
audiences went out to her, and she, bewitchingly,
responded to them. On the 1878 tour she relied
chiefly on her former success as Lilian in "New
Men and Old Acres," and her appearance in her
sister Kate's original character of Dora, in the
Tennyson-Reade play of that name. This not only
conjured up happy reminiscences, but was in itself
a sweetly tender and sympathetic impersonation.
Charles Kelly, too, was very well placed in Henry
Neville's old part of Farmer Allan, and in his
make-up looked a perfect picture.</p>

<p>I often maintain that, if they only knew it,
provincial theatre lovers have certain advantages
over Londoners. Here is a case in point. They
saw Ellen Terry as Dora.</p>

<p>In 1878 they also had the opportunity of seeing
her as Iris, in an adaptation by Alfred Thompson of
"La Revanche d'Iris," called "All is Vanity." In
it were the elements of popularity, but it was short-lived.
She and her husband subsequently appeared
in it at a benefit performance given at the Lyceum
on behalf of that sound actor of the old school, Henry
Marston, and then it was forgotten.</p>

<p>In 1879 the Terry-Kelly programme was augmented
by the production of an ephemeral version by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
Mrs. Comyns Carr of the everlasting "Frou Frou,"
entitled "Butterfly." Guided as it has been, and
happily still is, by that great authority on dramatic
art, Sir Edward Russell, the <cite>Liverpool Daily Post</cite>
has always been famous for its theatrical criticisms,
and in dealing with these days it is interesting to
cull the following lines from its columns:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We cannot find words to express the charm with
which Miss Terry, than whom there is no more tender
and graceful actress on the British stage, invests the
character of Butterfly, but those who can appreciate
versatility of acting should see her play the part, and
then ask themselves the question&mdash;'Could any one
do it better?' She was most ably supported by Mr.
Charles Kelly and Miss Fanny Pitt, whose acting
greatly contributed to the success of the piece."</p>

<p>Of "New Men and Old Acres" the same authority
rightly said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is seldom that such a piece is rendered with
such perfection as that which the leading members
of the cast succeeded in achieving. There is only
one word which can adequately describe Miss Terry's
personation of Lilian Vavasour, and that word is
perfection. Natural and graceful in expression, with
an inexhaustible vivacity, she maintains an unbroken
spell, which is only deepened by each fresh stroke
of humour and girlish outburst of sentiment, accompanied
by a bewitching artillery of attitude and
expression. The acting of Mr. Charles Kelly as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
Mr. Brown, the quiet, self-possessed man of business,
was excellent in the extreme."</p>

<p>Of her reading of Lady Teazle in the screen scene
of "The School for Scandal," it was recorded that her
tenderly, tremulous, and broken accents touchingly
conveyed the womanly contrition which so pathetically
points the moral of a dramatic incident in
which human infirmity, passion, perfidy, generosity of
sentiment, and youthful gaiety and frivolity are so
wonderfully and skilfully blended. And of her Dora,
it was "something more than a mere stage-picture&mdash;a
living, breathing reality, a perfect embodiment of
Tennyson's conception."</p>

<p>In the September of 1880 a very interesting
event took place, and as it foreshadowed one of my
heroine's greatest subsequent triumphs I shall speak
of it at length&mdash;or rather, I shall take the liberty
of letting that eminent critic, Mr. Davenport Adams,
speak for me.</p>

<p>"On Friday, September 3rd, Miss Ellen Terry
will play Beatrice <em>for the first time on any stage</em> at
the Grand Theatre, Leeds."</p>

<p>That was his text for an article from his pen
that appeared in that unhappily defunct periodical,
<cite>The Theatre</cite> magazine.</p>

<p>"I forget," he continues, "when and where I first
cast eyes on this delectable announcement. It may
have been here, it may have been there. I only
know that when I saw it I came to an immediate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
and irrevocable resolution. Miss Terry as Beatrice!
Why, it was one of the dreams of my existence!
I say 'one of the dreams,' because I had hoped,
and still hope, to see Miss Terry not only as
Beatrice, but as Viola, and Imogen, and Rosalind,
and perchance as Juliet, if the gods but prove
propitious. But Miss Terry as Beatrice! To me
it was an 'opening paradise.' My dreams were
coming true. Here was the first instalment, and
who should say when the remainder might not
be realised? Assuredly there might be some who
would resist such an attraction as the above;
but I was not among them. Friday, September
3rd, saw me duly speeding northwards as fast as
the Midland Railway Company could be induced
to carry me. I had never been in Leeds before,
and I do not hesitate to say that, save under
similar provocation, I have no anxiety to go there
again. Yet what cannot the imagination do for
one? For me, on this occasion, Leeds was
'apparelled in celestial light.' Boar Lane and
Briggate became for the nonce the primrose path
which led me to the halcyon doors of the Grand
Theatre. And fine doors they are! Everything
is a little new, perhaps; there is nothing of the
venerable temple of the drama about this brand-new
building, with its imposing frontage and evident
commodiousness. Clearly, you say to yourself, this
is a specimen of recent handiwork, and requires<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
time in which to mellow; but once get through
the delightfully cool passages, which lead from
the vestibule to the stalls&mdash;once put your foot
within the auditorium&mdash;and you are charmed with
everything you see. It may be all very fresh, but
it is all very magnificent and impressive. <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">O si
sic omnes!</i> If every theatre roof were but so
high&mdash;if every pit were but so spacious and well-lighted&mdash;if
every circle, upper circle, and gallery
were but so gracefully superimposed one above
the other&mdash;and, especially, if everywhere there
were such a rich profusion of decoration as one
sees around one! Evidently there could be no
more gorgeous frame for the picture which Miss
Terry was about to paint for us.</p>

<p>"It was Miss Terry's benefit night, and every
stall was taken. This seemed to be the case, too,
with the circle, and may have been so with other
portions of the house. It seemed as if the pit
were crammed, and in the stalls standing room
was diligently sought for. It was obvious that
Leeds playgoers had understood the nature of the
treat that was before them. Whether it was that
Miss Terry was personally the attraction of the
evening, or whether Miss Terry as Beatrice had
drawn the crowd, I cannot say. Suffice it that
the crowd was, and that the crowd soon showed
itself to be delighted."</p>

<p>I cannot refrain from quoting this at length,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
because it supports my contention as to the privileges
and appreciation of provincial audiences.</p>

<p>"In the meantime," my authority goes on to say,
"one did not occupy much time in looking round.
It was not a London <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">première</i>, and certainly I did
not hope to see a single face I knew. Yet, what
was this? I could not be mistaken. There at any
rate were two faces which I could not fail to recognise.
At least, if that winsome countenance were
not that of Miss Marion Terry, and if that not less
winsome countenance beyond were not that of Miss
Florence Terry&mdash;twin roses on one stalk&mdash;then did
mine eyes deceive me. For myself, I opine that I
was not deceived, and that Miss Terry's first appearance
as Beatrice was witnessed not only by the
art-lovers of the wood and iron metropolis, but by
two of her sisters, both in art and by blood.</p>

<p>"It was not long before the curtain rose, and
disclosed to us the entrance of 'Leonato, Hero,
Beatrice, and others.' The Beatrice was immediately
singled out, and loud and long was the applause with
which she was received&mdash;applause which she insisted,
first, upon sharing with the Hero (not the heroine)
of the evening (Miss Ruth Francis),<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> but which she
was compelled afterwards to acknowledge for herself.
The opening scene, as everybody knows, plunges us
at once <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">in medias res</i>. Beatrice shows by her first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
utterance what way her thoughts are tending, and
this strikes the key-note of the comedy. Her first
expression is a gibe at Benedick, and when, shortly
afterwards, the 'Signior Montano' himself appears
upon the scene, the war of wits immediately begins.
Let it be said <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">in limine</i> that Miss Terry at once
asserted herself as the very Beatrice that Shakespeare
drew. That she would do so as far as personal
presence was concerned was to be expected.
Never was any one so well fitted to represent the
'pleasant spirited' lady, whose charms of face and
figure are as irresistible as her verbal daggers.
Somehow or other Miss Terry always is a perfect
vision of the picturesque. Others may surpass her
in special and particular marks of beauty or of
manner, but no lady on the modern stage is so
much of a picture in herself, or falls so readily into
the composition of the larger picture formed by the
combinations of a drama.</p>

<p>"In this case Beatrice seemed to be bodily before
us. Ere she had opened her mouth she had already
begun to fill the imagination. We do not have many
opportunities nowadays of seeing the heroine of
'Much Ado,' but here was the only Beatrice who
had hitherto completely fulfilled the requirements of
the part, so far as the outward and visible person
is concerned. I cannot describe the vision. I admit
my incompetency so to do without a blush. A pen
is useless. It is the brush of a Millais that is wanted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
The picture is in my mind, but not even a Ruskin
could put it on paper. For, to the mere details of
face and figure and attire, have to be added all the
indescribable charm of facial expression and of bodily
movement&mdash;of tone, of laugh, of gesture, and of
bearing&mdash;which neither the penman nor the painter
can successfully reproduce.</p>

<p>"For such a character as that of Beatrice Miss
Terry is, in fact, by nature indicated. Characteristics,
which elsewhere might be out of place, are here in
keeping. Miss Terry is tall, and Beatrice should be
tall; a little woman could hardly have said and done
such things as she says and does. Miss Terry has
high spirits, and so has Beatrice; they are of the
essence of her character, and without them she
cannot be reproduced. Miss Terry has charm of
manner as well as incisiveness of speech, and so has
Beatrice, with whom the 'poniards' of her tongue
are half blunted by the fascination of her smile.
You would think that her eyes pierced as keenly as
her words, but it is not so; the words may wound,
but the eyes mitigate or charm away pain. So with
Miss Terry. Speeches which in any other mouth
would grate upon us are in hers but so many incitements
to admiration and regard.</p>

<p>"And if Miss Terry is thus personally fitted for
the character, it need hardly be said that it is quite
within the range of her artistic capability. Indeed,
it is well within the range of many less admirable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
artists. It is a straightforward character. There is
no mystery about it. Two different notions of
Beatrice are, I should say, scarcely possible&mdash;her
nature is so entirely on the surface. She tells us
herself that she was 'born to speak all mirth and no
matter.' 'She was born,' says Don Pedro, 'in a merry
hour.' Benedick calls her 'My Lady Disdain' and
'Lady Tongue.' 'Shrewd of tongue,' according to
her uncle, she also 'apprehends passing shrewdly.'
In a word, she is clever, she is high-spirited, she is
witty; but she is more. She can feel keen indignation,
and for all her 'mocking at her suitors,' she can
look tenderly upon one at least. For obviously she
loves Benedick, more or less, from the beginning.
Her first inquiry is for him, and she thinks him
worthy of her most unsparing raillery. She sneers at
him so pointedly that all the world marks the fact
and smiles at it. Nothing seems more natural
to the bystanders than that they should make a
match.</p>

<p>"And so, it seems to me, Miss Terry sees the
character. In the very first scene she pursues
Benedick with her flouts and quips, and evidently
takes pleasure in the encounter. Though she hits
so hard there is evidently an <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">arrière pensée</i> of respect
for the gallant cavalier whose 'approved valour'
cannot but impress her, whilst his 'quick wit' not
unmingled with self-satisfaction spurs her on to
action. One can see that when she scoffs at marriage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
it is with no more real sincerity than Benedick
displays on the same subject. Her wit must have
its way; conscious of possessing it, she is fain to
exercise it. She revels in the contempt she pours
upon the 'sons of Adam.' And so in the scene in
which she taunts the masked Benedick to desperation.
It is all done in pure <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">diablerie</i>. It is simple
mischief, inspired by keen delight at finding her butt
so agreeably vulnerable. That she is no mere shrill-tongued
termagant is shown in the passage where
she so gracefully turns off the Don's gallant offer of
his heart and hand. And as for her deeper nature&mdash;the
real Beatrice, hidden underneath the everyday
veneer of wit and raillery&mdash;what could be more truly
descriptive of it than the scene in which, led into
the belief that Benedick is really fond of her, she
says farewell to maiden pride and to contempt, and
prepares to 'tame' her 'wild heart' to his 'loving
hand'? The accusation brought against her cousin
is not less effective in arousing the latent forces of
her character; and the church scene, in its combination
of passionate anger against Hero's slanderers,
and charming half-confession of affection felt, is conclusive
in its testimony to the open naturalness of
the character which Miss Terry has so aptly and
admirably conceived. As for the <em>technique</em> of the
performance, it must be remembered that it was a
first assumption. Miss Terry <em>may</em> have played the
part somewhere before September 3rd, but the fact is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
not recorded, and there is no reason to believe that
the announcement of 'first time' was anything but
literally true. And that being the case, it would be
unfair to expect the impersonation to be <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">totus teres
atque rotundus</i>. Miss Terry has all the ultra-sensitiveness
of the true artist, and it is not improper to
suggest that, on the occasion in question, she was not
entirely mistress of her powerful resources. The
most experienced players are the most nervous on
first nights. And assuredly there are points in which
Miss Terry will improve upon her first assumption of
this latest part of hers. Some artists grow into their
<i>rôles</i>, and Miss Terry is one of them. Her Portia
nowadays is very much superior to what it was when
played originally at the Prince of Wales'. And no
doubt Miss Terry, who has since played Beatrice at
Manchester and elsewhere, during her provincial tour,
has already added the touches necessary to make the
representation as near perfection as art and aptitude
can make it. No doubt every word, every phrase,
every sentence now has its due weight and effect
communicated to it; no doubt details of 'business'
have been arranged until there is now no room for
further elaboration; no doubt the character, thoroughly
grasped in the study, has by this time been thoroughly
grasped upon the stage. On the first night it was
hardly possible not to notice the nervousness indicated
in the opening scene, and throughout there were
slight slips in the words, and occasional misplacements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
of due emphasis, together with a lack of
perfect roundness in the general form of the assumption.
The artist was obviously to a great extent
feeling her way.</p>

<p>"And yet how enjoyable and admirable was the
assumption! In spite of these minor blemishes of
execution, it was yet Shakespeare's Beatrice, I
repeat, who stood and moved and spoke before us.
The impression made at the beginning was continued
to the close, gathering in force and effectiveness as
it went. The raillery against marriage, and the wit
combats with Benedick, were carried off with exhilarating
vivacity, so that applause and laughter
followed inevitably upon both. The former was
accompanied by a running fire of cachinnation from
the delighted audience. The next point was made
when Benedick was charmingly chaffed as the
'Prince's jester,' and the short but exquisite <em>rencontre</em>
with Don Pedro was evidently very much
relished. The first 'call' was made when Beatrice
came to summon her knight to dinner. The curtain
fell on this, and Miss Terry and Mr. Kelly had both
to bow their acknowledgments. Then came the
scene in which Beatrice listens in the arbour to the
delusive tale of Ursula and Hero. The short speech
which follows was very agreeably declaimed; and
when, declaring her belief in Benedick's deserts,
Beatrice sank upon the seat in one of those attitudes
possible only to Miss Terry, the impression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
made was naturally very great indeed. The chief
scene for Beatrice is, however, in the church after
the bridal party has dispersed, all save herself and
Benedick. Up to that point she has little to do
but contribute her share of byplay to the situation
(always appropriately done by Miss Terry), to comfort
her cousin with all sorts of feminine attention,
and incidentally to make that vehement declaration&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">'Oh, on my soul, my cousin is belied!'</p>

<p>which gives the earliest indication of the characteristic
outburst that is to follow. In that outburst
itself, Miss Terry was hardly sufficiently varied in
her representation of the feeling which is supposed
to consume her. It was very impressive, especially
in the sudden violence of her 'Kill Claudio!' but
it wanted that absolute adaptability of means to
end which has no doubt been communicated to it
since. Best of all, perhaps, was the brief exchange
of love vows with Benedick; a very brief but charming
and beautifully-indicated episode in a scene
which, as a whole, pleased the audience mightily,
and secured for both the artists a persistent 'call.'
After this, as we all know, Beatrice has but two
short appearances on the stage, which serve chiefly
to complete the picture, but, on this occasion, served
further to consummate the triumph which, anything
or everything notwithstanding, was unquestionably
and deservedly accorded to Miss Terry. The curtain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
fell, in fact, upon an unmistakable popular
success which it wanted only practice and experience
to convert into a permanent artistic victory.</p>

<p>"It should be recorded that Miss Terry was effectively
seconded throughout by Mr. Kelly. That able
and accomplished actor was the Benedick of the
occasion, and a very acceptable performance did he
give. I confess I was not altogether prepared for
the excellence of the effect created by Mr. Kelly in
this <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">rôle</i>. His very make-up was a surprise. Could
this gallant cavalier&mdash;bearded, whiskered, and moustached,
with the bronze of battle on his cheeks, and
just the faintest <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">soupçon</i> of the dandy and the lady-killer
in his manner&mdash;be the quiet, serious-minded
Brown of 'New Men and Old Acres' in another
guise? It was a revelation. And if the appearance
of Mr. Kelly was a revelation, so, to some extent,
was his enjoyable and largely satisfying rendering
of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">rôle</i> itself. Mr. Kelly's conception of Benedick
is that of a man who has passed the first flush
of youth, has seen many men and cities, has had
his experience of 'the fair,' and is inclined to think
somewhat lightly of them, save, indeed, of this 'Lady
Disdain,' who so stabs him with her words. It is
easy to see that he is not indifferent to her charms,
else why is he so affected by her quips and cranks?
else why is he so readily converted from his vaunted
woman-hatred? It is easy, too, to see that this
stalwart knight, of 'noble strain' and of 'quick wit,'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
is the very man on whom such a woman as Beatrice
would naturally bestow her thoughts. He, too, has
his deeper nature as well as she. And Mr. Kelly
brought out the various differentia of the character
very artistically. The woman-hatred was soon seen
to be skin deep. The irritation at the 'chaff' of
Beatrice was skilfully indicated without being over-done.
The soliloquy in reference to his 'not impossible
she' was spoken with excellent abandon,
whilst the speech after his supposed discovery of
Beatrice's love for him was admirable in its delineation
of delighted surprise. Equally successful was
Mr. Kelly in the scene where Benedick is badgered
by Claudio and Don Pedro, and that other passage
in which he conveys his challenge to the former.
The unconscious comedy of the one was as well considered
as the serious dignity of the other.... For
the rest, I have but one regret in reference to this
performance, and that is, that the exigencies of the
play do not permit Beatrice to be upon the stage
throughout the whole of the comedy. Dogberry and
Verges are inimitable, and Benedick is everywhere
acceptable; but still if Shakespeare had only given
us a little more of this not least charming of his
charming heroines! Could he have foreseen the
Beatrice of Miss Ellen Terry, he would, perhaps,
have done so. And yet, I do not know. Too much
exhilaration is not good for us, and it is perhaps
the truest mercy that Beatrice should not be for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
ever scattering about her verbal diamonds, and that
Miss Ellen Terry should not for ever make the
stage brilliant and enchanting by her delightful
presence."</p>

<p>The cast of this memorable Leeds production was
in many ways an interesting one. Mr. Philip Beck
was Don Pedro; Mr. C. Brookfield, Don John; Mr.
Norman Forbes, Claudio; Mr. Arthur Mood, Dogberry;
Mr. Lin Rayne, Verges; and Miss Elinor
Aickin, Ursula.</p>

<p>How, in accordance with Davenport Adams' prediction,
Ellen Terry's Beatrice developed into a
"permanent artistic victory" we all know to-day.
Undoubtedly, and as we shall presently see, it was
one of the finest, and in some respects (for her comedy
is so winsome) one of the most attractive of her long
series of Shakespearean triumphs at the Lyceum.</p>

<p>What a series it has been! It is not surprising
that she should say&mdash;"I seem to have made the
acquaintance and to <em>know</em> quite intimately some noble
people&mdash;Hamlet and Ophelia, Portia, Benedick, and
Beatrice, Romeo and Juliet, Viola, the Macbeths.
All this makes me rejoice and wonder how it is that
I'm not a superior person! I have dwelt with such
very good company. It has been all sunshine, with
a wee cloud here and there to give zest to life; and
my lines have been laid in pleasant places. How
terrible it must be to have to do the work one
abhors!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>It is because she has done the work that she loves,
and has made the sweet tenderness of her love for
it so manifest, that she has continually stirred the
imagination, and lastingly won the hearts of her
audiences.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="p4">MARION AND FLORENCE TERRY</p>


<p>While Ellen Terry was firmly cementing her
popularity and ever adding to her fame, two of the
younger members of her gifted family had come to
the front to add to the honour of the name they bore.
These were her sisters, Marion and Florence. It is
generally understood that the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">début</i> of Florence
Terry was made in 1870, while the first appearance
of Marion Terry was delayed until 1873, but I
think there may have been a good many previous
tentative performances. The Terrys always believed
in groundwork, and we may be sure that these
young ladies were carefully taught the art of
acting.</p>

<p>My old friend, W. H. Vernon, has told me how,
when he was fulfilling his long engagement under
Henry Neville's management at the Olympic Theatre,
the two young sisters played with him in an old-fashioned
one-act drama by John Howard Payne,
entitled "Love in Humble Life." Their mother was
constantly with them, and Kate Terry used to
"coach" her sisters at rehearsal. They were quite
unaccustomed to the stage, but, says my friend, "the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
Terry charm was there, crude, and unformed as it all
was."</p>

<p>"Love in Humble Life" does not offer much scope
for acting, and the girls had to content themselves
with playing on alternate nights the one feminine
character of Christine.</p>

<p>In 1870 Florence Terry was certainly ripe for a
public appearance in a piece of importance. On June
15th, at the Adelphi&mdash;the theatre in which, it will be
remembered, her sister Kate had said her farewell&mdash;she
went through the ordeal and acquitted herself
right worthily. The piece was an English version of
Molière's "Le Malade Imaginaire," entitled "The
Robust Invalid," and her part was that of Louison.
Although his name did not appear in the bills, it was
generally understood that the adaptation was from
the pen of the Terrys' old and well-tried friend,
Charles Reade, and the chance was a good one for
the young artiste. Vining and Mrs. Seymour were
in the cast and all went well.</p>

<p>In connection with "Le Malade Imaginaire," it
can never be forgotten that Molière was playing his
own creation in it when he broke a blood-vessel.
Gallantly he struggled on to the hour of curtain fall,
and then, in a dying state, was taken to his home.</p>

<p>In the November of 1870 Florence Terry was
engaged to play Little Nell at the Olympic Theatre
in Andrew Halliday's stage version of "The Old
Curiosity Shop"; probably one of the best adaptations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
from Dickens (how unsatisfactory they all are!)
that has been seen in the theatre.</p>

<p>No one who saw it will forget the exquisite
pathos and tenderness with which she endowed the
character of the sorely tried, yet always gentle-souled
and trusting child. She made us think, as
Bret Harte has sweetly put it, that we</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"Read aloud the book wherein the Master</div>
  <div class="i1">Had writ of 'Little Nell,'"</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>and she took us by the hand until, "on English
meadows," her audiences</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"Wandered and lost their way."</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>No doubt she was greatly helped by the
deeply impressive and affecting portrayal by George
Belmore of the weak-minded but affectionate old
grandfather. The two made a perfect picture.
The Quilp of the cast, in the person of clever John
Clarke, is a thing that, in its effective, savage,
grotesque, and always true realism, haunts the
memory.</p>

<p>Marion Terry made her first bold, histrionic
plunge in 1873. This was at the Crystal Palace,
when she played Ophelia to the Hamlet of Steele
Mackaye. Mackaye was the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">protégé</i> of Tom
Taylor, and the then leading English dramatist
made a new acting version of Shakespeare's
masterpiece for his behoof. Great things were
expected of it, but the production merely excited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
passing curiosity, and though it was taken to the
Shakespeare-loving provinces it soon flickered out.
Thus did Marion and Florence Terry&mdash;"twin roses
on one stalk," as Davenport Adams called them&mdash;take
the rank of Princesses in Stage Land.</p>

<p>The career of Florence Terry was destined to
be a brief one, but, happily, Marion Terry is still
with us, still charming us; and every one will
agree with Clement Scott's words&mdash;"She is one of
the very few actresses I have known who has never
gone back from her gentle career of continued
success. On and on she has wended her way,
improving and improving. With her gifted sisters,
some characters have suited her better than
others; but from the old Olympic days down to
the present time I never remember to have been
disappointed with Marion Terry, or wished she had
not appeared in such and such a character."</p>

<p>In 1874 she became a prominent member of
Henry Neville's company at the Olympic, appearing
(<i>inter alia</i>) in an English version of "Le
Mariage de Figaro," by James Mortimer, entitled
"A School for Intrigue." Henry Neville was the
Almaviva, Edward Righton the Figaro, and Emily
Fowler the Suzanne. Later, in a revival of "Much
Ado about Nothing," she made a very winsome
Hero to the Beatrice of Emily Fowler, the Benedick
of Henry Neville (this was a delightful reproduction
of Shakespeare's spirited picture), the Don<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
Pedro of W. H. Vernon, the Dogberry of Edward
Righton, and the Verges of G. W. Anson. Then
she migrated to the Strand Theatre, to play in
some of H. J. Byron's pleasant comedies, such as
"Old Sailors" and "Weak Woman." Of the last-named
play, Edward Leman Blanchard (never inclined
to be enthusiastic) said that it was "a
brightly written and most ingeniously constructed
piece; excellently acted, and having a well-deserved
success." As its heroine, Marion Terry became
very popular, and successes were also made by
Ada Swanborough, W. H. Vernon, J. G. Grahame,
Harry Cox, and Edward Terry. In the hands of
the last-named admirable comedian&mdash;and thanks
to the excellence of his acting in the eccentric
character of Captain Ginger&mdash;"Weak Woman"
still holds the stage. On September 11th, 1876,
came the young actress's first great chance, and
right worthily she availed herself of it. On that
evening W. S. Gilbert's three-act drama, "Dan'l
Druce, Blacksmith," was produced at the Haymarket
Theatre, and to her was allotted the one
feminine, but all-important, part of Dorothy. The
dramatist had avowedly taken the episode of the
first act&mdash;the finding by the saturnine blacksmith
of a wee but winning girl-baby in his lonely
hermitage&mdash;a mere hut by the sea-shore&mdash;from
George Eliot's beautiful story, "Silas Marner," but
that was all the better, for it formed the prelude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
to a most interesting play. In it Marion Terry
made an instantaneous success by the absolute
simplicity of her acting. With a grip rare in so
young an artiste, she had realised her author's
meaning; her love-scenes (with Forbes Robertson)
were finely presented, and, throughout the two
acts in which she appeared, her quietly won victory
was from the first apparent, and ultimately complete.
With such actors as Hermann Vezin,
Henry Howe, Odell, and Forbes Robertson, she
easily held her own, and shared in the honours
of a notable artistic success.</p>

<p>In the October of 1877 there was a greater and
even a unique triumph. This was in W. S. Gilbert's
whimsically conceived and wittily written farcical
comedy "Engaged,"&mdash;in its way a gem of the first
water, with its every facet cut and polished to the
point of resplendency. Good as was the acting of
George Honey as Cheviot Hill, Fred Dewar as Angus
Macalister, Harold Kyrle (Kyrle Bellew) as Belvawney,
Henry Howe as Mr. Symperson, Lucy Buckstone
as Miss Symperson, Emily Thorne as Mrs.
Macfarlane, and Julia Stewart as the "Lowland
Lassie," Maggie Macfarlane, the Belinda Treherne
of Marion Terry capped them one and all. It was,
indeed, an impersonation as humorous as it was
original. If it had not been interpreted as she
interpreted it, the very fabric of the work might
have fallen; but the extreme cleverness of her acting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
in a most difficult part held it up, and she became
a joy to all endowed with a true sense of fun. It
will be remembered that the character is that of a
young lady who, apparently steeped in romantic
notions, possesses a remarkably matter-of-fact mind.
She manifestly believes in herself, but, under the
surface of her honeyed rhodomontade, she has to let
the audience see the under-current of her secret and
worldly aspirations. Badly done, the character would
have been impossible. Handled as it was by Marion
Terry it became not only delicious in its humour,
but strangely convincing. Let us listen to the ring
of one or two of the sentences with which she was
called upon to deal.</p>

<p>In the first act she meets the susceptible Cheviot
Hill; he immediately falls in love with her, and in
reply to his words of gushing admiration she says&mdash;</p>

<p>"I cannot deny that there is much truth in the
sentiments you so beautifully express, but I am,
unhappily, too well aware that, whatever advantages
I may possess, personal beauty is not among
the number."</p>

<p>And when he has replied&mdash;</p>

<p>"How exquisitely modest is this chaste insensibility
to your own singular loveliness! How
infinitely more winning than the bold-faced self-appreciation
of underbred country girls!"</p>

<p>She answers&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am glad, sir, that you are pleased with my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
modesty. It has often been admired." The whole
house rocked with laughter, and there, on the stage,
stood the graceful, pretty, and impassive girl, who,
in a very remarkable way, had given meaning to
the writer's every word. Her lines were so ridiculous,
yet so telling, that we all felt it a wonder
that she did not laugh with us. No! Like the
perfect, well-graced actress she has ever been, she
lived in her part, and seemed absolutely to forget
that she was playing to a crowded audience.</p>

<p>One more instance.</p>

<p>In the third act the amorous Cheviot returns
from his mission to Scotland to find that during his
absence his two English lady-loves, Belinda Treherne
and Minnie Symperson, have (at least) been amusing
themselves with the dangerous Belvawney. Prompted
by absurd jealousy, the ridiculous man expostulates;
he cannot bear to hear that the girls, who ought to
have been pining for him, have been amused by the
impostor's conjuring tricks, that they have, in short,
to use his own words, been "Belvawneying." The
following conversation ensues:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span> Have you seen him (Belvawney) bring a live hen, two
hair-brushes, and a pound and a half of fresh butter out of his
pocket-handkerchief?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cheviot.</span> No, I have not had that advantage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Belinda.</span> It is a thrilling sight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cheviot.</span> So I should be disposed to imagine. Pretty goings
on in my absence. You seem to forget that you two girls are
engaged to be married to <em>me</em>!</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Belinda.</span> Ah, Cheviot, do not judge us harshly. We love you
with a reckless fervour that thrills us to the very marrow&mdash;(<i>to</i>
<span class="smcap">Minnie</span>) don't we, darling? But the hours crept heavily without
you, and when, to lighten the gloom in which we were plunged,
the kindly creature swallowed a live rabbit, and brought it out,
smothered with onions, from his left boot, we could not choose but
smile. The good soul has promised to teach <em>me</em> the trick.</p></blockquote>

<p>Could anything be more superlatively or irresistibly
ludicrous than this? And yet Marion Terry,
with an unmoved and quietly angelic face, spoke the
words as if she absolutely believed in them, and
scored a success for the author that he could hardly
have anticipated.</p>

<p>Again, when with all her own carefully planned
motives in full play, Belinda comes dressed in funereal
and stately black to the home of her rival, Minnie
Symperson, on the day of that outwardly artless
young lady's strictly "quiet" wedding with the
fickle and faithless Cheviot Hill, she serenely says:
"At last I am in my darling's home, the home of
the bright, blythe, carolling thing that lit, as with a
ray of heaven's sunlight, the murky gloom of my
miserable schooldays. But what do I see? Tarts?
Ginger wine? There are rejoicings of some kind
afoot. Alas! I am out of place here. What have I
in common with tarts? Oh, I am ill attuned to
scenes of revelry," and then takes a tart, and, with
calm appreciation, eats it. Once more the house
shook with merriment, but she remained as composed
as if she were taking part in some solemn and
sacred rite.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>Many very clever actresses have since played the
part, but they have perforce acted on the lines
originally laid down by its creatress. They have
all been popular, but there has been only one and
incomparable Belinda Treherne, and she was Marion
Terry. To those who could appreciate its extreme
cleverness, "Engaged" made a delightful and even
fascinating entertainment, though it has truly been
said that the play afforded a picture of humanity
more cynical than had been painted since the days
of Swift.</p>

<p>In March 1879, Marion Terry earned another
debt of gratitude from W. S. Gilbert. This was at
the Olympic Theatre in "Gretchen," a play in four
acts. The author stated that the leading idea of
this work was suggested by Goethe's "Faust," but
that, with the exception of a scene between Mephisto
and Martha, the dialogue was original. It was not
only original but brilliant, and if the piece failed to
draw the multitude it was through no fault of its
author.</p>

<p>Joseph Knight said of it:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Never, perhaps, in the history of letters has an
experiment been tried bolder or more startling than
that of Mr. Gilbert in the production of 'Gretchen.'
When Dryden and Davenant and their successors
undertook to remove the crude work of Shakespeare
to suit their own more cultivated tastes, there was
nothing especially courageous in the action. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
fame of Shakespeare did not then stand on the
pinnacle in the sight of all men it has subsequently
occupied. From its first appearance, however, the
'Faust' of Goethe took intellectual Europe by storm.
So sensible is Mr. Gilbert of the worth of the work
with which he deals, he justifies his own effort on the
one ground that the play he alters is not suited to
dramatic exposition, and he fortifies his opinion on
this point by quoting the assertion of Schlegel, in his
lecture on German drama, that 'Faust' runs out in
all directions beyond the limits of the theatre." To
the thoughtful, "Gretchen" was a most interesting
production, and no doubt much of its charm was due
to the gentle and maidenly style, and quiet earnestness
of Marion Terry as its deeply sinned against
heroine.</p>

<p>We have only to take these three important and
original characters&mdash;Dorothy, Belinda Treherne, and
Gretchen&mdash;to prove that she is not only a consummate,
but a curiously versatile actress.</p>

<p>But the three striking triumphs did not follow
each other in succession. In 1877 she had, at the
Haymarket, followed Mrs. Kendal (this, seeing what
a matchless performance that had been was a formidable
ordeal) as Galatea, and won much and
well-merited praise&mdash;and in the following year she
supported Sothern as the heroine of that ill-fated
production, "The Crushed Tragedian," by H. J.
Byron.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>That was poor Sothern's last bid for popularity
in an original character, and its failure in London
(it had been a great success in America) was a disappointment
from which he never quite recovered.</p>

<p>Concerning it he had written:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It appeared to me that if I could good-naturedly
satirise the old school of acting, contrasting it
through the several characters with the present
school, I should arrive at the same effects in another
manner which were produced in Dundreary; that is
to say, that though stigmatised by everybody as a
very bad tragedian, I should gain the sympathy of
the audience in the satire, however much they might
laugh at my peculiarities. The character is not an
imitation of any one actor I have ever seen. I have
simply boiled down all the old school tragedians as I
boiled down all the fops I had met before I played
Dundreary. I tested the piece in Philadelphia, and
its success was immediate. In my judgment, 'The
Crushed Tragedian,' if not the best part in my repertory,
is likely to command popular favour at once
wherever it is performed, and to retain its hold upon
the stage for many years."</p>

<p>Before producing the piece in London he had,
according to his custom, "tried" it in the provinces,
and in Birmingham it was most enthusiastically
received. Sothern was in high spirits that night. "I
have got my second Dundreary success," he declared
to me; "I didn't know how my 'Fitz' would go in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
England, but I see it's all right, and, mark me, this
means five hundred nights at the Haymarket!" Full
of assurance he left the next day for London. In the
evening "The Crushed Tragedian" was produced at
the Haymarket, and&mdash;well, the sad fate of that
version of Byron's play is a matter of theatrical
history. The next day he wrote: "An organised
system to d&mdash;n the piece. Rows of hissers. We'll
see who'll win!" We know now who won&mdash;and I
fear that the loss of that game told heavily on
Sothern's heart. It is not for me to defend, in the
face of abler critics, "The Crushed Tragedian," but I
think that all who saw the impersonation will allow
that it contained many touches by no means unworthy
of the creator of Dundreary. It was, however,
<em>caviare</em> to the general, and in London failed to
attract.</p>

<p>In the midst of his disappointment Sothern told
me how delighted he was with the acting of Marion
Terry in the character of Florence Bristowe. As the
old prompter Henry Howe was excellent.</p>

<p>Her next engagement was with the Bancrofts at
the old Prince of Wales' Theatre, and her first important
part there was that of Mabel Holne in
James Albery's adaptation of Victorien Sardou's "Les
Bourgeois de Pont-Arcy," entitled "Duty." In all
these impersonations it was aptly said (in the words
of Ruskin)&mdash;she possessed "a serenity of effortless
grace."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>Of course within the limits of these pages it is
impossible to follow her throughout her distinguished
career. On several occasions she has followed her
sister Ellen in some of her most famous parts, playing
Olivia, Clara Douglas, and Margaret in the famous
Lyceum version of "Faust." Her blind girl in "The
Two Orphans," and her sweetly tender Mrs. Errol
in "Little Lord Fauntleroy," will never be forgotten.</p>

<p>Her successes with George Alexander at the St.
James's Theatre in "Sunlight and Shadow," "The
Idler," "Lady Windermere's Fan," "Liberty Hall,"
and other plays, are fresh in the memory; and so is
her appearance at the Criterion Theatre with Charles
Wyndham in "The Physician." Her acting as Lady
Valerie in this play by Henry Arthur Jones was
indeed charming.</p>

<p>In the same author's "Michael and his Lost
Angel," produced by Forbes Robertson at the Lyceum,
her acting of a most difficult character was summed
up by that sternest of critics, William Archer,
as "perfect." And so, indeed, it was. She also did
good work with the Bancrofts in some of their
revivals of the Robertson comedies, especially distinguishing
herself as Blanche Haye in "Ours," and
Bella in "School."</p>

<p>The comparatively brief stage career of Florence
Terry is necessarily less noteworthy, but she is gratefully
remembered in the provinces as Olivia, as Lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
Betty Noel in Tom Taylor's stirring historical play
"Lady Clancarty," as Dorothy in W. S. Gilbert's
"Dan'l Druce," and as Jenny Northcote in the same
brilliant author's evergreen "Sweethearts." She also
figured in some of the great Lyceum productions. In
"The Merchant of Venice" she was a very pretty and
engaging Nerissa, and she was entrusted with the
character of the unfortunate Lady Ellen in the revival
of the younger Colman's drama "The Iron Chest," in
which Henry Irving took John Philip Kemble's
original character of Sir Edward Mortimer. In all
these parts she evinced the almost unique persuasive
charm possessed by her sisters.</p>

<p>On June 21, 1882, in view of her forthcoming
marriage and retirement from the stage, a singularly
interesting event took place at the Savoy Theatre.
In W. S. Gilbert's dainty fairy play "Broken
Hearts," Marion Terry appeared as the Lady Hilda
and Florence Terry as the Lady Vavir, parts originally
taken at the Court Theatre by Mrs. Kendal and
Miss Hollingshead. This was followed by the trial
scene from "The Merchant of Venice," in which
Henry Irving was the Shylock, Ellen Terry the
Portia, Marion Terry the Clerk, and Florence Terry
the Nerissa.</p>

<p>Thus, and for the first and last time, the three
gifted sisters appeared on the stage together.</p>

<p>Florence Terry (Mrs. William Morris) died in
1896.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>It is surely good for the old playgoer to conjure
up such recollections as these. Some of us already
live more in the past than in the present, and one's
pleasure is the sum of happy memories of other times
and faces gone.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="p4">HENRY IRVING</p>


<p>Before Ellen Terry gratefully and gracefully acknowledges
the great roar of welcome that greeted her on
her first appearance on the Lyceum stage, it seems
right to say a few words concerning Henry Irving
and his position in the theatrical world at the time
when (not far short of twenty-five years ago) he
made this all-important engagement. He had
already achieved far greater things than he could
have dreamt of in his toilsome 'prentice days, and
for some time had deservedly been recognised as
the head and leader of his profession, as an actor
whose name will live with those of Burbage, Betterton,
David Garrick, Edmund Kean, and the other
histrionic giants of the past, whose memories we
cherish. Not suddenly, but by dint of sheer hard
work, the victory had been won, and those who
had in his earlier days detected his genius were
very proud of him.</p>

<p>I had seen him in the days when he acted
as a more or less obscure member of the good
old provincial stock companies, when he was often
called upon to appear in three plays on one night,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
and earned little or no money for his services.
He has told me of an engagement when with his
poor salary in hopeless arrear he was compelled
(armed with a well-studied appeal) to thrust himself
into the managerial presence, and to be rewarded
with&mdash;a <em>cigar</em>!</p>

<p>Never had a young actor so many formidable
conditions to face. His first appearance on any
stage was at Sunderland, in the September of 1856,
and, in representing the small part of the Duke
of Orleans in Lord Lytton's "Richelieu," the first
words he uttered, behind the footlights, were (surely
there was something prophetic about them!), "Here's
to our enterprise!" How little did those who acted
with him that night, and looked down upon him
as a novice, think that as Richelieu himself he
would ultimately win that chorus of applause which
forms the world's tribute to genius.</p>

<p>But poor young Irving's "enterprise" at first
appeared to be a forlorn hope.</p>

<p>While at Sunderland he suffered terribly from
nervousness, and, being cast for the subordinate
part of Cleomenes in "A Winter's Tale," he broke
down. He had been called upon at very short
notice to take the character, and, through no fault
of his own, had inadequately studied it. He got
through the first four acts well enough, but when
in the fifth act he had to speak alone, his presence
of mind, and his memory, entirely left him. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
could not remember a word of his part; he merely
muttered, "Come on to the market-place, and I'll tell
you further," and rushed off the stage in despair.</p>

<p>Then the local critics were down upon him,
and his friends warned him to abandon an effort
that was evidently beyond his powers. But young
though he was, and disheartened though he must
have been, Henry Irving had faith in himself, and
determined to overcome all obstacles. He had to
work hard, and he had to live hard, but his career,
though often crossed by the forbidding stream of
discouragement, was one of steady progress, and
his comrades of these struggling days have told
me that whatever he had to endure (and the
endurance must have been as bitter as it was
long), he never forgot to be that thing so impossible
of definition, and so capable of recognition&mdash;a gentleman.
Indeed, having from the very outset keenly
watched his public career, while I have for many
years been privileged to enjoy his personal friendship,
I have often thought that Henry Irving
might have taken for his motto the well-known
lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"The World has battle-room for all,</div>
  <div class="i1">Go! fight, and conquer if ye can;</div>
  <div class="i0">But if ye rise, or if ye fall,</div>
  <div class="i1">Be each, pray God, a gentleman."</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>One of his most charming characteristics is that
he has never forgotten an old friend. <em>Videlicet</em>: in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
the troubled days of 1856 there was playing at
the Sunderland theatre a comedian named Sam
Johnson. He never achieved great things, but he
encouraged the anxious aspirant with kindly words,
and in the after years he found himself an honoured
member of the famous Lyceum company.</p>

<p>In these early days I did not see any performance
by Henry Irving that could strictly be called
impressive, and yet, to me, and to many others,
there was something in his appearance and manner
that was singularly attractive. We did not realise
it then, but no doubt it was that subtle charm that,
for want of a better name or definition, we call,
in an actor, "magnetism." Added to this was his
wonderful capacity for painstaking, which, according
to Thomas Carlyle, is the very essence of genius.
For some time he was a member of the well-conducted
stock company of the Theatre Royal, Edinburgh.
The late Robert Wyndham, the genial and
highly-esteemed proprietor of that historic playhouse,
once told me that though in those early
days he did not look upon Henry Irving as a particularly
promising actor, he was always struck with
the intense care that he took over any part entrusted
to him, however small and insignificant it might be.
"I am certain," he said, "that Henry Irving, without
being in the least degree a fop, would have gone
without his dinner in order to buy a 'button-hole,'
or any such trivial adornment that he thought might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
add, even in the minutest degree, to the effect of the
part in which he had to appear."</p>

<p>But for a long time the critics were painfully
and, as I think, perversely against him. They either
did not understand or waywardly resented the crack
of the new whip. In 1865, at the Prince of Wales'
Theatre, Birmingham, I saw him play Laertes to
the Hamlet of Fechter. It was an original Laertes,
and not modelled on the perfunctory reading of the
part generally adopted by the ordinary provincial
stock-actor of those days. To me, and I am sure
to the large majority of the audience, it was a
very interesting and entirely satisfying performance,
but it was recorded by a local critic as "as bad as
could be."</p>

<p>This is only one example of many little stabs that
must have wounded him at the time. But I noticed
that he never altered his methods, and in due season
he convinced his would-be censors that he knew more
than they did. From the time when he played Rawdon
Scudamore at the St. James' Theatre, to the
day when he made his first great triumph as Mathias
at the Lyceum, it was my good fortune to see him in
nearly all his London impersonations&mdash;as Harry
Dornton in "The Road to Ruin," as Bob Gassitt in
H. J. Byron's "Dearer than Life" (in which at the
Queen's Theatre he shared honours with J. L. Toole
and Lionel Brough), as Compton Kerr in Dion Boucicault's
much discussed "Formosa" at Drury Lane,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
as Mr. Chevenix in H. J. Byron's "Uncle Dick's
Darling" at the Gaiety, and in many other parts
(one and all played with the touch of a master); until
at the Vaudeville Theatre, as Digby Grant in James
Albery's "Two Roses," he put the seal to his reputation.
How some of us, who had faithfully followed
him about from theatre to theatre, carefully watching
and delighting in his growing reputation, rejoiced
when we knew that he had conquered his opponents
and become a king of the stage. How excited we
were when in "The Bells" at the Lyceum he made
the world ring with his praises.</p>

<p>It was when he was playing the part of Redburn
in H. J. Byron's "Lancashire Lass" at the Queen's
Theatre that he excited the admiration of Charles
Dickens. Some years later the eldest son of the
great novelist said in the course of a speech that his
father had spoken with enthusiasm of "a young
fellow in the play who sits at the table and is bullied
by Sam Emery; his name is Henry Irving, and if
that young man does not one day come out as a great
actor, I know nothing of art."</p>

<p>Charles Dickens might have seen Henry Irving's
graphic impersonation of Bill Sikes in a poor stage
version of "Oliver Twist," in which Toole used to
revel in the character of "The Artful Dodger," but
he did not live to appreciate his life-like impersonation
of Jingle. Sensitive as the author always was with
regard to the interpretation of his creations in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
theatre, that inimitable and realistic stage-portrait
would surely have satisfied him.</p>

<p>Never, it may safely be said, has any actor been
more popular than Henry Irving, not only with the
public but with members of his own profession. That
he deserves his popularity no one who has studied
his remarkable career will deny; that he has won it
"facing fearful odds" his most intimate friends and
ardent admirers must candidly admit. Even to-day,
when his fame is so firmly established, that he could,
if it troubled him at all, laugh at adverse and hostile
criticism, we find any number of self-constituted and
ridiculously complacent censors ready to tell us that
he won his spurs by a fluke, and that he cannot be
regarded as a great actor. Men existed who said the
same of Betterton, Garrick, and Kean. But how
absurd it is to hear such opinions when we know that,
thanks to him, the Lyceum Theatre has for years and
years been the cherished resort of all that is intellectual
in modern life.</p>

<p>When he first began to make his successes, and had
the jealousy that he has long since vanquished to fight,
his so-called "mannerisms" (and is it not a truism
that there never was an actor, or, for the matter of
that, author, yet without some mannerism or speciality
that made him a man of mark and so attracted the
public to his piping?) were mercilessly caricatured
and lampooned, and a weaker man might well have
been crushed under the heaps of ill-natured ridicule<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
that were, mud-like, hurled at him. But an indomitable
worker as well as a brave and generous man he
rose superior to it all, and in a few busy, and no
doubt very anxious, years the difficult sum was done
in order that it might be incontestably proved, and
to the satisfaction and advantage of all except the
croakers, who even less than any one else understand
their own croakings, our great English actor
of to-day holds his throne.</p>

<p>"What a blessed thing it is," said wise Oliver
Wendell Holmes, "that Nature, when she invented,
manufactured, and patented her authors" (and
original actors take rank amongst the best of authors),
"contrived to make critics out of the chips that were
left."</p>

<p>No actor more conclusively proves the rightly
held theory that the perfection of dramatic art can
only be achieved by early apprenticeship and many
years devoted to earnest study and incessant hard
work than Henry Irving. In a period of three and
a half years he had played no fewer than four
hundred and twenty-eight parts before his claim to
be regarded as one of the most promising actors of
his day was even considered. Well might the actor
ponder over Chaucer's beautiful lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"The lyfe so short,</div>
  <div class="i0">The crafte so long to lerne,</div>
  <div class="i0">The essay so hard,</div>
  <div class="i0">So sharpe the conquering."</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>If he cared to make one, Henry Irving's reply to
his detractors might well be that he has stood the
inexorable test of time. Since he first wore his
laurels a new and very critical generation has sprung
up&mdash;a generation that has little or no respect for
tradition, that has abundant choice of entertainment,
and only cares to pay for what it chooses to see.</p>

<p>Face to face with this somewhat intractable tribe,
Henry Irving has for more than a quarter of a century
held his own, and America has united with
England in hailing him as the living master of
dramatic art in its purest and highest form. From
the first he was wise enough to know that even the
best and greatest of men, to say nothing of the
greatest and best of actors, cannot afford to stand
alone. As a matter of consequence he surrounds
himself with a company composed of the best dramatic
talent of the day, and his productions are
mounted with a general and generous richness, and
a minute attention to detail never, until his time,
attempted on the stage.</p>

<p>Then take the quality of the plays produced at
the Lyceum, as compared with those morbid and
unsavoury ones that during recent years we have
seen in too many leading playhouses. Somebody wondered
the other day why Adam had never been made
the hero of a play, and a cynic suggested that it is
because it is not possible to mix up his name with that
of some married woman. If Adam is to have his stage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
chance it must be under the unsullied banner of
Henry Irving.</p>

<p>Great as a leader of men as he has proved himself
to be, modesty and unselfishness are prominent among
his characteristics. Although Queen Victoria, in recognition
of his personal worth and public services,
created him a Knight (let it be remembered this was
the first time that such a distinction had been conferred
upon an actor), he still loves to be called plain
Henry Irving. Proud as he was&mdash;and is&mdash;of the
honour that, through him, has been bestowed upon
his profession, on the day when he was privileged
to call himself "Sir Henry" in the play-bills, he
merely put his pen through the prefix "Mr.," so that
he might remain to the public, as well as to his
friends, "Henry Irving." When Ellen Terry was
asked, "Have you got used to Sir Henry's title?"
she prettily replied, "Oh yes! He has been a Prince
in my eyes for many years;" and in doing so she
unconsciously spoke for all his associates. Well, in
1878, Irving, having completed his brilliant engagements
with the renowned Bateman family, found
himself not only the chief actor and attraction, but
manager of the Lyceum Theatre.</p>

<p>"His first effort," says Percy Fitzgerald, "was to
gather round him an efficient and attractive company.
It became presently known that Ellen Terry was to
be his partner and supporter on the stage, and it was
instantly, and almost electrically, felt that triumph<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
had been already secured. People could see in advance,
in their mind's eye, the gifted pair performing
together in a series of romantic plays; they could
hear the voices blending, and feel the glow of dramatic
enjoyment. This important step was heartily
acclaimed. No manager ever started on his course
cheered by such tokens of goodwill and encouragement,
though much of this was owing to a natural
and selfish anticipation of coming enjoyment."</p>

<p>To-day we know how that dream of enjoyment has
been realised, and how, under the reign of Henry
Irving and Ellen Terry at the Lyceum, we have
found, in the words of the poet Campbell&mdash;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="p4">AT THE LYCEUM THEATRE, 1878-1883</p>


<p>Those who are truly interested in the stage must be
more or less familiar with a Lyceum first-night under
the reign of Henry Irving. He has made the long
series of them prominent among the events of the
day, and rich and poor alike are eager to be present.
We know how the frequenters of the cheaper parts
of the house will, in order to obtain good seats,
assemble and wait patiently in the Strand from sunrise
to sundown; we know how difficult it is to
obtain seats at the besieged box-office; we know
how from the front row of the pit to the back seats
of the gallery the house is densely packed with an
audience assembled to hear and see all that is noblest
in English dramatic art. It is more than impressive
to watch the faces of the patient and expectant
pit; and to listen to the sounds in the eager and
impulsive gallery; while as to the stalls and boxes,
in them you see the cream of those who are distinguished
in the paths of art, science, and literature.
It is magnificent to be able to command such an
audience; on the other hand it must be formidable
to face it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>It was to such an assemblage as this that Ellen
Terry had to make her bow when on the evening of
December 30, 1878, she first appeared at the Lyceum,
playing Ophelia to the Hamlet of Henry Irving. No
doubt it was a trying and anxious moment for her,
but the true ring in the long and loud welcome which
greeted her on the threshold of the home in which
she was destined to do so much noble work must
have gone to her heart, and assured her that all
would be well.</p>

<p>It was indeed a momentous evening in the history
of our stage. Of it Dutton Cook said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. Irving's managerial career has commenced
most auspiciously. The opening representation was,
indeed, from first to last, triumphant. A distinguished
audience filled to overflowing the re-decorated
Lyceum Theatre, and the new <i>impresario</i> was
received with unbounded enthusiasm. These gratifying
evidences of goodwill were scarcely required,
however, to convince Mr. Irving that his enterprise
carried with it very genial sympathy. His proved
devotion to his art, his determination to uphold the
national drama to its utmost, have secured for him
the suffrages of all classes of society. And it is
recognised that he has become a manager, not to
enhance his position as an actor&mdash;for already he
stands in the front rank of his profession&mdash;but the
better to promote the interests of the whole stage,
and to serve more fully, to gratify more absolutely,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
the public and his patrons. Let it be added, as a
minor matter, that he has followed the good examples
set by Mr. Hollingshead and Mr. Bancroft, and has
been careful of the comfort of his audience, neither
permitting them to be pinched for room, nor subjecting
them to those petty imposts which, like so
many turnpike dues, have so persistently impeded
the visitor on his passage from the street to his seat
within the theatre.</p>

<p>"The tragedy of 'Hamlet' was well chosen for
the first performance under the new management&mdash;as
Hamlet Mr. Irving has obtained his greatest success.
It has been said that no actor has ever been
known to fail as Hamlet; it may be added that no
actor has ever as Hamlet completely satisfied critical
opinion. To many the play is a metaphysical study
wholly unsuited for theatrical exhibition; 'an enigmatic
work,' as Schlegel says, 'resembling those
irrational equations in which a fraction of unknown
magnitude always remains that will in no way admit
of solution.' To many Hamlet is a mysterious and
complex character, beyond the power of histrionic
art adequately to interpret. Mr. Irving can, at any
rate, point to the fact that, four years ago, for two
hundred nights in succession, he played Hamlet to
delighted crowds at the Lyceum. Weighed against
popular success so consummate and prodigious, objections
of any kind are as but feathers in the scale;
and even those least disposed to accept this latest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
stage portraiture of Hamlet can afford to admit that
the picture is in itself consistent and harmonious, the
work of an ingenious and intellectual artist."</p>

<p>Yes, there were some who (in a hopeless minority)
were still indisposed to accept the new Prince of
Denmark, but by the sensible and appreciative his
impersonation by Henry Irving will ever be honoured
as one of the most complete, harmonious, profound,
and artistic seen on the stage. Never was more
thought given to the study and representation of
very small phases of Hamlet's character. The result
was a powerful, refined, graceful, intelligent interpretation
in every detail, and as such it was applauded
by the public.</p>

<p>Of Ellen Terry's acting on that memorable evening
my authority says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"An Ophelia so tender, so graceful, so picturesque,
and so pathetic, has not been seen in the theatre
since Macready's Hamlet, many years ago, found his
Ophelia in the person of Miss Priscilla Horton. In
characters of this class, the heroines of genuine
poetry, Miss Terry is now without a rival, is indeed
unapproached by any other actress upon our stage.
Her personal graces and endowments, her elocutionary
skill, her musical speech, and, above all, her singular
power of depicting intensity of feeling, are most happily
combined, as the audience was quick to discover
and applaud in this very exquisite presentment of
Ophelia."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>In summing up the performance, Joseph Knight
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Of Mr. Irving's Hamlet we have already spoken.
It is not greatly changed. The outline is distinctly
the same as before, though much pains have been
bestowed on the filling up. We do not accept as
new readings the delivery while sitting of speeches
formerly spoken standing, or other like alterations
in arrangement. Nor do we feel that changes of
method as regards matters of detail call for special
comment. The one vital alteration of conception
appears to consist in presenting Hamlet as under the
influence of an overmastering love for Ophelia. A
knowledge of his own weakness seems to inspire him
when, subsequently addressing Horatio, he says&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0"><span style="margin-left: 9em;">"Give me that man</span></div>
  <div class="i0">That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him</div>
  <div class="i0">In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of hearts."</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The chief grace in the new representation consisted
in the delivery of the speeches to Ophelia in the
third act. In this the mocking tone did not for a
moment hide the profound emotion under which
Hamlet laboured, and the hands which repulsed her
petitioning hands trembled with passionate longing.
That this view of Hamlet is correct will scarcely be
disputed. That he loved Ophelia he declared over
her grave; that he felt it his duty, under the influence
of a task such as that enjoined him, to erase<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
from the table of his memory all 'trivial fond records,'
he also states. The indications of the pain
it costs a nature such as this, quick in resolution
and shrinking and incapable in action, to inflict on
the woman he loves the grief it is yet necessary she
should sustain, are well conceived. That they were
effective in action was ascribable to a great extent
to the admirable acting of Miss Terry. Picturesque,
tender, and womanly throughout, Miss Terry on one or
two occasions gave an inspired rendering of Ophelia.
The support she afforded Mr. Irving was of the
utmost importance, and the scene before the play
has probably never been so well rendered."</p>

<p>I think it well to quote these undoubted authorities,
lest readers might think that in my palpable
admiration for these artists my personal judgment
would be biassed.</p>

<p>I cannot end my little record of the auspicious
evening of December 30, 1878, without noting that
then Bram Stoker assumed his position as chief in
the front of the house. How much he has done to
make the Lyceum Theatre popular its frequenters
fully recognise. Always genial and courteous, he
plays the important part of host right well, cheerily
attending to the comforts of one and all. Probably
he would prefer to devote the whole of his time to
writing his tenderly conceived and well loved romances
(do we not owe to him "Under the Sunset," "The
Snake's Pass," "The Shoulder of Shasta," and many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
other graceful fancies?); but happily for us, though
we want more of his charming books, he remains true
to his post, and has made himself as well liked in the
provinces as he is in London.</p>

<p>Speaking of Ellen Terry's triumph as Ophelia,
Percy Fitzgerald tells us that "on this momentous
night of trial she thought she had completely failed,
and, without waiting for the fifth act, she flung
herself into the arms of a friend, repeating, 'I have
failed, I have failed!' She drove up and down the
Thames Embankment half-a-dozen times before she
found courage to go home."</p>

<p>The newspapers of the next morning must have
given her assurance that for her was no such word
as fail!</p>

<p>The next production at the Lyceum was "The
Lady of Lyons." Of Ellen Terry's appreciative
rendering of the character of Pauline I have
already spoken. It need only be said now that
it exercised its former charm. Henry Irving had
evidently given great thought to the study of Claude
Melnotte, and at times he was deeply impressive;
but the part cannot take rank amongst his greatest
successes.</p>

<p>Then came a revival of the stage version by
W. G. Wills of Thomas Hood's "The Dream of Eugene
Aram," which had, of course, been suggested by the
impression made through Henry Irving's graphic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
recitation of that thrilling poem. In this Ellen Terry
succeeded Isabel Bateman as Ruth Meadows, but
"Eugene Aram" is a one-part play, and affords few
chances for an actress.</p>

<p>Again she followed Isabel Bateman in the revival
of W. G. Wills' beautiful play, "Charles I.," which
was given on June 27, 1879. As the pathetically-drawn
Queen Henrietta Maria, Ellen Terry once more
had her opportunity, and she grasped it. The hapless
Queen ranks as one of her most sympathetic and
womanly impersonations, and she played it with even
more than her wonted sweetness when the play was
reproduced at the Lyceum as recently as June 23,
1901.</p>

<p>As Charles Stuart, Henry Irving unquestionably
finds at once one of his most dignified and pathetic
creations.</p>

<p>For nearly thirty years the play has held the
stage, and in view of that very rare fact it is interesting
to recall its original production. This was
in the September of 1872, under Colonel Bateman's
Lyceum management, when Henry Irving had made
his notable success in "The Bells," and was the talk
of the town. Both by manager and actor much
anxiety was felt as to the next play to be produced,
and they were both delighted when W. G. Wills
suggested the story of the unhappy Charles I. as a
subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>In common with most successful plays it had its
tribulations before it faced the footlights. Though
possessed of true feeling and inspiration, the author
was carried away by his ardour into a neglect of the
canons of the stage, writing masses of poetry of
inordinate length, which he brought to his friends
at the theatre, until at last they began to despair.
Many changes had to be made before the poem could
be brought into satisfactory shape. Originally, the
piece opened with the second act, but the practical
Colonel Bateman exclaimed: "Oh, bother politics!
Give us some domestic business." This led to the
introduction of the tranquil, pastoral scene at Hampton
Court. The closing scene, as desired by the author,
represented the capture of the King on the field of
battle. "Won't do," said the Colonel bluntly; "must
wind up with another domestic act." Sorely perplexed
by this requirement, which they felt was
necessary, both author and actor tried many expedients
without success, until one evening the
manager suddenly called out, "Look at the last
act of 'Black-Eyed Susan!'" And so it came
about that the affecting farewell between the
doomed Charles and his weeping Queen was
due to Douglas Jerrold's time-honoured nautical
play.</p>

<p>That "Charles I." was an immediate stage success
is a matter of ancient history, and in an odd way it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
had bold advertisement. One of those vehement and
amusing discussions which occasionally arise out of
a play, and furnish prodigious excitement for the
public, was aroused by the conception taken of Cromwell,
which was, in truth, opposed to tradition; for
the Protector was exhibited as willing to condone
the King's offences, and to desert his party, for the
considerations of a marriage designed to gratify his
own social ambition. This ludicrous view, based on
some loose gossip, was, reasonably enough, thought
to degrade Cromwell's character, and the point was
debated with much fierceness. It was also argued
that the dramatist had made Charles not only a
hero and a martyr, but also a modern gentleman
with superior manners and a melancholy smile.
But the public forgave the slanders for the sake
of the prettiness and the pathos of the domestic
scenes.</p>

<p>The play was not only revived in 1879 but in
1883, and again in 1893. In 1901 it exercised all its
old charm. The best advice to those who go to see
it is not to expect historical accuracy, but, without
criticism of the dramatist's portraits of the King and
Cromwell, to heartily enjoy a delightful and soul-stirring
drama. It is only the other day that Ellen
Terry said, "There is nothing more beautifully
pathetic in the world than Sir Henry Irving's
Charles." And she is right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>At the end of this busy season, in the last
days of hot July, Ellen Terry, on the occasion of
her manager's benefit, played Lady Anne to his
Gloucester in the first act of "Richard III.," and
then, as we have seen in a former chapter, she
started on her provincial tour.</p>

<p>She did not return to London until the late
autumn. On November 1, 1879, we first saw that
beautiful revival of "The Merchant of Venice,"
which, thanks to Ellen Terry's Portia and Henry
Irving's Shylock, became one of the greatest of
the long series of Lyceum triumphs, and remains
to this day one of the most attractive items in
the Irving repertory.</p>

<p>His impersonation of the "Jew that Shakespeare
drew" is as instinct with purpose to-day as it was
in 1879. I know that there are some critics who
declare that he imparts so much dignity to the
character that he dwarfs the other portraits in
the play. That is true of the actor, but surely
these critics are wrong? Most students of Shakespeare
realise that Shylock never became actively
malignant until the Christians, who on the Rialto
had insulted him, who had called him misbeliever
and cut-throat dog, and spat upon his Jewish
gaberdine, had robbed him of his daughter and
his ducats. Then the sufferance that he declared
to be the badge of all his tribe broke down.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
Then, being a man as well as a Jew, he became,
not unrighteously, savage, showed his teeth, and,
living in a cruel age (when human torture was a
thing of every day), viciously resolved to have
his "pound of flesh." It is hardly likely that he
thought it would come in his way when, in "a
merry sport," he signed the bond with Antonio.
That is the filled-in picture that Henry Irving gives
us of this wonderfully outlined character. We may
be horrified at the vindictive moods of his Shylock,
but we understand him, and realise the cruel
wrongs that have worked him up to a frenzied
hatred of his bantering tormentors. He makes us
see the patient endurance and personal dignity
of the man, and, if at the end of the grandly
wrought story we cannot quite sympathise with
him, we are called upon to acknowledge the infinite
patience of his punishment. To thousands
and thousands of playgoers, and to those who
dearly love their Shakespeare, Henry Irving has
illumined the superbly limned design of Shylock.</p>

<p>Of Ellen Terry's Portia, in the days of the
Bancrofts at the old Prince of Wales' Theatre, I
have already spoken. In 1879 it was found to be
as good as ever&mdash;nay, better than ever&mdash;for not
only had time ripened her talent, but brought her
into contact with a virile Shylock. She has indeed
made the character her own, and this fact has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
been long acknowledged not only in England but
in America. It remains to-day exactly what it has
ever been, a perfectly executed realisation of one
of Shakespeare's most beautiful feminine creations.
And, indeed, whether it be in her handsome Italian
gowns, or disguised as the "young and learned
doctor" from Padua, she makes a lovely and most
fascinating picture. Her illustration of the wonderful
text leaves nothing to be desired. It carries
with it the inspiration of genius, and yet it is all
so sweetly natural. "As the gentle rain from
heaven," it "drops upon the place beneath," and
in the hearts of her hearers sets new, bright, and
fragrant thoughts upspringing; while throughout
it all runs the refined essence of dainty humour.
Whenever I see such perfectly soul-satisfying
Shakespearean portraits as these, I think of the
matchless stained-glass windows in our grand
churches and old cathedrals. Beautiful in themselves,
as they are now, their designs must have
at one time been crude and cold in the hands of
their originators. But filled in with softly, yet
richly-coloured and exquisitely blended glass (not
with the hot reds, violent blues, and gaudy ambers
that hopelessly disfigure so many modern efforts
in this direction), they seem to soothe while they
illuminate, and ineffaceably fulfil their earnest,
bright, and inspiring intention.</p>

<p>On December 10, 1879, a benefit performance
was given at the Lyceum, on behalf of William
Belford, an actor who had done splendid service
under Samuel Phelps at Sadler's Wells, and who
in later years had been prime favourite as principal
comedian at the Strand Theatre. He was not only
a fine actor, but a prince among good fellows, and
pre-eminent in the London Bohemia of those days,
the happy home of the literary men, artists, and
actors, of which Geoffrey Prowse wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"The longitude's rather uncertain,</div>
  <div class="i0">The latitude's equally vague;</div>
  <div class="i0">But that person I pity who knows not the city,</div>
  <div class="i0">The beautiful city of Prague."</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In 1879 poor Belford's health broke down. Like
many of his kind in the good-natured, easy-going,
and absolutely unselfish circles to which he belonged,
he had made little or no provision for such
a disaster, and right cheerfully his friends came to
his aid, just as in stage-land friends invariably do.
Henry Irving played his famous character of Digby
Grant in "The Two Roses," and this was supplemented
by a performance of the "Trial" scene
from "Pickwick," in which many prominent actors
appeared. Ellen Terry, who had met William
Belford in the Charles Kean days at the Princess's,
very appropriately, as well as very beautifully,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
delivered an address from the deft pen of Clement

<p>Triumphantly the "Merchant of Venice" pursued
its course until, in May 1880, its last act was omitted,
and it was succeeded by "Iolanthe," a version by
W. G. Wills of Henrik Hertz's Danish play, "King
René's Daughter." The chief character in this had
been a favourite one with that consummate artiste,
Helen Faucit (Lady Theodore Martin). The piece
was exquisitely staged, and finely played by Ellen
Terry and Henry Irving; it was very tender, and
very touching, but it has not taken a permanent place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
in the Lyceum repertory. On January 3, 1881, Lord
Tennyson's two-act drama, "The Cup," the "great
little play," as Ellen Terry called it, was produced,
and another great victory was gained. Clement
Scott considers her acting in this to have been one
of the finest of her many inspirations, and says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ellen Terry as Camma, aptly realised the poet's
lines&mdash;</p>

<p>Who that ever heard it can forget the pathos of
Ellen Terry as she parted from Sinnatus, and delivered

<p>I for one" (and here Clement Scott speaks for many
of us) "shall never forget the end of the play, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
the libations poured in honour of Artemis, and amidst
music and flowers and processions, faultless in colour,
and of classic pomp, making the dull mind live in
another age, we hear intoned with strophe and antistrophe
of chanting chorus, the double appeal by
Camma and Synorix, containing as it does the most
impassioned poetry of the play.</p>

<p>"I said at the time, 'If there ever was a play
that from its intrinsic merits demanded a second, if
not a third visit, it is "The Cup." At present the
landscape of Mr. W. Telbin, and the decorative
splendour of Mr. Hawes Craven's Temple of Artemis,
absorb all attention. We seem to see before us the
concentrated essence of such fascinating art as that
of Sir Frederick Leighton and Mr. Alma Tadema in
a breathing and tangible form. Not only do the
grapes grow before us, and the myrtles blossom, the
snow-mountains change from silver-white at daytime
to roseate hues at dawn, not only are the Pagan
ceremonies acted before us with a reality and fidelity
that almost baffles description, but in the midst of all
this scenic allurement glide the classical draperies of
Miss Ellen Terry, who is the exact representative of
the period she enacts, while following her we find
the eager glances of the fate-haunted Mr. Irving.
The pictures that dwell on the memory are countless,
and not to be effaced in spell or witchery by any
of the most vaunted productions of the stage, even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
in an era devoted to archæology. We see, as we
travel back through the enchanting vista, the first
meeting of Synorix and Camma&mdash;he with his long
red hair and haunting eyes, his weird pale face
and swathes of leopard skins; she with her grace
of movement, unmatched in our time, clad in a
drapery sea-weed tinted, with complexion as clear
as in one of Sir Frederick Leighton's classical
pictures, and with every pose studied but still
natural.</p>

<p>"We remember Camma as she reclined on the low
couch with her harp, moaning about her husband's
late-coming, and can recall the hungry eyes of
Synorix, as he drank in the magic of her presence.
All was good here, the tenderness of the woman, the
wicked eagerness of her lover, the quick impulsive
energy of the husband. Difficult as it was to study
the acting, when so much had to be seen, still it was
felt that Mr. Irving, Mr. Terriss, and Miss Ellen
Terry had well opened the tragedy long before the
first curtain fell.</p>

<p>"There were time and opportunity, at any rate,
to comprehend the subtlety of Mr. Irving's expression
in that long soliloquy&mdash;how well it was broken
up, and how face accorded with action when Sinnatus
lay dead, and the frightened Camma had fled to the
sanctuary of the Temple. With the first act but little
fault could be found. The fastidious among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
audience who complained of dulness and want of
action, possibly forgot that whilst their eyes were
feasting on the scenery, their ears were closed to the
poetry, and on another visit will confess how much
meaning and study were at the first blush lost to
them. With the aid of the text, the beauties hidden
for the moment will reappear. As for the second
act, with its groupings, its grace, its centre figures
and surroundings, its hymns to Artemis, its chants
and processions, we are inclined to doubt if the stage
has ever given to educated tastes so rare a treat.
In the old days, such pictures might have been
caviare to the general public, but the public at the
Lyceum is one of culture and a very high order of
intelligence. Such poems are necessarily for the
fastidious and the elegant in mind and scholarship;
but granted the right of the stage to demand such
poetic studies, it would be impossible for modern
scenic art to give them more splendour and completeness.
Æsthetic tastes have had their necessary
ridicule and banter, for everything that is
affected is hateful to the ordinary English nature;
but here, in this Temple of Artemis, when Miss
Ellen Terry, veiled as the Galatian priestess, stands
by the incense-bearing tripod, and Mr. Henry
Irving, robed in the scarlet of Rome's tributary
King, comes to demand his anxiously expected bride,
there is an aiming at the beautiful and thorough,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
most creditable in itself and distinctly worthy of
respect."</p>

<p>No doubt the production of "The Cup" was
a bright feather in the managerial cap of Henry
Irving, and Ellen Terry took her full share in its
colours.</p>

<p>Let me hark back a little to recall an evening in
the previous Lyceum season when I was fortunate
enough to hear Ellen Terry's thrilling rendering of
the one character in Monk Lewis's dramatic poem,
"The Captive." This strange writer, with his skulls
and his crossbones, his coffins and shrouds, his ghosts
and his goblins, is rarely read now; but for the sake
of the actress's performance in it this weird piece of
work was well worth revival. In the memoirs of
Lewis we come across a letter written to his mother
in 1803, just before the first performance of "The
Captive." "The 'monodrama' (as he called it)
'comes out,' he says, on Tuesday. I have not yet
been at a single rehearsal. It cannot possibly succeed."
In one way it did succeed. At Covent
Garden Mrs. Litchfield (a famous actress in her day)
recited the fearsome lines allotted to the wretched
maniac prisoner. The character is that of a mad-woman,
and Mrs. Litchfield's embodiment of the
author's horrible imaginings, combined with the
scenic effects and other startling appearances which,
with his usual skill, he introduced into the piece,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
threw a portion of the audience&mdash;whose nerves were
unable to withstand the dreadful truth of the language&mdash;into
hysterics, and the whole theatre into
confusion and horror. Never, it is said, did Covent
Garden present such an appearance of agitation and
dismay. Ladies bathed in tears, others fainting,
and some shrieking with terror&mdash;while such of the
audience who were able to avoid demonstrations like
these sat aghast with pale horror painted on their
countenances.</p>

<p>In another letter to his mother, Lewis says:
"The papers will have already informed you that
the monodrama has failed. It proved much too
terrible for representation, and two people went into
hysterics during the performance, and two more after
the curtain dropped. It was given out again with
a mixture of applause and disapprobation, but I immediately
withdrew the piece. In fact, the subject
(which was merely a picture of madness) was so
uniformly distressing to the feelings that at last I
felt my own a little painfully, and as to Mrs. Litchfield
she almost fainted away. I did not expect that
it would succeed, and of course am not disappointed
at its failure. The only chance was whether pity
would make the audience weep, but instead of that
terror threw them into fits, and of course there was
an end of my monodrama."</p>

<p>At the Lyceum Ellen Terry brought about no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
such scene as that created by Mrs. Litchfield at
Covent Garden. It is true that she harrowed as
well as held her audience, and that the memory of
her acting must haunt all who witnessed this bold
venture; but her art was delicate as well as intense,
and she was able to draw those tears so desired by
the author. It is a pity that he could not see his
"monodrama" at the Lyceum in 1880.</p>

<p>On April 16, 1881, "The Cup" was preceded
by Mrs. Cowley's comedy, "The Belle's Stratagem,"
with Ellen Terry as Letitia Hardy. She played the
part with invincible vivacity and perfect grace, and
in the picturesque costumes of a bygone period, looked
like a portrait by an old master come to life. But
what a thing to do! Camma and Letitia Hardy&mdash;tragedy
and comedy&mdash;in one evening! It was a
proof alike of her marvellous versatility and her
great power of physical endurance. To the delight
of his admirers, Henry Irving resumed his old part
of Doricourt, and played it brilliantly. By the way,
in connection with this impersonation, there is another
instance of an actor thinking he has failed
where he has really succeeded.</p>

<p>Of his first appearance at the St. James' Theatre in
the character, he has said:&mdash;"I was cast for Doricourt,
a part which I had never played before, and which
I thought did not suit me. I felt that this was the
opinion of the audience soon after the play began.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
The house appeared to be indifferent, and I believed
that failure was conclusively stamped upon my work,
when suddenly, upon my exit after the mad scene,
I was startled by a burst of applause, and so great
was the enthusiasm of the audience that I was compelled
to reappear upon the scene, a somewhat unusual
thing except upon the operatic stage." Despite
his doubts the part has remained one of the best and
one of the most popular of his comedy incarnations.
Of the new Letitia Hardy, Clement Scott truly
said:&mdash;"She is as Georgian in her comedy graces
as before she was Pagan in her rites as the priestess
Camma. Entering heart and soul into the spirit of
the play, she attacks it with a wilfulness and an
abandon that are indescribable. She trips and floats
through the scenes. There is no effort in anything
that she does; and when she assumes the character
of the hoyden it is in the finest spirit of refined and
disciplined fun. With every chance for exaggeration,
the rein is never relaxed, and so captivating is
the spirit of the artiste that she makes the audience
hold its breath to the point of tension, and is rewarded
with the quick response of unrestrained
applause. Equally charming is the temptation scene
at the minuet; and when Miss Terry, mask in hand,
floats, glides, and coquets around the bewildered
Doricourt, one's mind recalls the records of fascination
in varied romance, and understands, possibly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
for the first time, what Circe might have done to
Ulysses&mdash;how the fair-haired German nymphs of
the Lorelei turned the heads of dreamy knights&mdash;how
Undine weaved her spells&mdash;and how old Merlin
collapsed under the influence of the wily Vivien.
Unknowingly, Miss Ellen Terry is a poem."</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1880 the great American tragedian,
Edwin Booth, came to England to fulfil an
engagement at the Princess's Theatre, and his reception
had not been one to make those who take
loving interest in the dramatic art of this country
proud. How well I remember poor Sothern (he was
then in his dying days) waxing wroth over the
neglect with which the man whom he declared to
be the "finest and most graceful actor in the world"
was treated. I think many others felt the same,
and Henry Irving, at least, was determined that
his great rival should not recross the Atlantic until
he had had a fair hearing in London. With characteristic
generosity and delightful courage, he invited
Booth to appear with him at the Lyceum in Othello,
so that the leaders of English and American dramatic
art might be seen on the stage together, and in all
courtesy cross swords, alternating the finely-balanced
yet splendidly contrasted parts of the Moor and Iago.
The invitation was cordially accepted, and in both
countries the event is regarded as one of the most
interesting in modern theatrical history.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>The general consensus of opinion was that Booth
triumphed as Othello, and that Irving eclipsed him
as Iago. No doubt Othello is by far the most difficult
part to play, and it was better suited to the
classical style of Booth than to the methods of Irving,
who, while he has reverence for tradition, delights
in taking a path of his own making. In some
characters this is a distinct advantage, and his Iago
was supreme. It will be remembered that Ellen
Terry was already familiar with the character of
the gentle Desdemona, and she played it with infinite
charm and inexpressible pathos. Hers must
have been a difficult task, for both Booth and Irving
took different readings of Othello and Iago, and she
had to adapt herself to both. Hazlitt said:&mdash;"All
circumstances considered, and platonics out of the
question, if we were to cast the complexion of Desdemona
physiognomically, we should say that she had
a very fair skin and very light auburn hair, inclining
to yellow." In Ellen Terry Hazlitt would have found
his ideal, not only in appearance but in art.</p>

<p>For Henry Irving's benefit at the end of the
season she played Helen to his Modus in those
happily conceived comedy scenes from "The Hunchback"
of Sheridan Knowles in which the two figure.
She once more proved herself to be the most piquant
of comediennes, and the Modus was delightfully
sketched.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>In the opening attraction of the next Lyceum
season, which commenced in the January of 1882,
Ellen Terry did not appear. This was a revival
of "The Two Roses," for by this time playgoers
were anxious to resume acquaintance with Henry
Irving in his first great original character, that
of Digby Grant. In Lyceum history the occasion
is noteworthy, for it introduced to its boards&mdash;as
the blind Caleb Deecie&mdash;George Alexander. Alexander
had been touring in the country under the
management of the younger Robertson, and those
who took the trouble to watch him with discriminating
eye had predicted for him a brilliant future.
So admirable was he in a character part in a
humorous piece called "The Guv'nor," that his name,
extolled by discerning provincial critics, reached
Irving's ears, and thus he won his first engagement
in London. His admirable work at the Lyceum
Theatre, before he went into management on his
own account, and by his tact, taste, and personality
once more made the St. James's (a playhouse which
since the departure of John Hare and the Kendals
had been allowed to droop) the resort of intellectual
as well as fashionable London, is well remembered.
It is a grand thing for a young and then comparatively
unknown actor to reflect that, with infinite
credit to himself, and to the great satisfaction of
the public, he played such vitally important parts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
as Faust to the Margaret of Ellen Terry, and Macduff
to the Macbeth of Henry Irving.</p>

<p>But the great production of this season was
"Romeo and Juliet." Never, probably, was a
Shakespearean play so superbly mounted. All the
resources of art were lavished upon it, and cost
was apparently outside consideration. The result
was a series of stage pictures that were absolutely
entrancing. If I were writing a history of the
Lyceum under the management of Henry Irving
I should gladly dwell on these things, and on the
work that he, both as manager and actor, put into
them, but I must remember that my text is Ellen
Terry, and, save for the all-important part which
she took in them, pass them briefly by. Other
writers have vividly described these matchless representations
in their entirety, and I must content
myself with a fragment here and there. My canvas
is a small one, and my picture must be that of
my heroine. If my accounts of the Lyceum revivals
are brief it is not from lack of appreciation of
them, and happily the memory of them is green.
So it is with the later impersonations of Ellen
Terry, and they will require no lengthy record at
my hands.</p>

<p>Her Juliet did not quite satisfy all the critics,
but she played the part for one hundred and thirty
nights to crowded and enthusiastic audiences, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
surely there could be no better criterion of success?
If, when compared with other Juliets, the extremely
exacting part did not seem to suit her as well as
others she had played, if it was held to be inferior
to her Ophelia, and below her Portia, the impersonation
won its way to the hearts of the people, and
in the public mind it increased rather than lessened
her reputation. Sarah Bernhardt, who was loud
in her praises of the performance, said to her sister
artiste&mdash;"How <em>can</em> you act in this way every night?"
"It is the audience," said Ellen Terry. "They inspire
me!" She might have added that she inspired her
audiences.</p>

<p>After the first performance she once more thought,
nay, even insisted, that she had failed. She wrote
to a friend&mdash;"A thousand thanks for your letter.
The fact remains that Juliet was a horrid failure.
<em>And I meant so well!</em> I am very sad, but I thank
you. <em>It is not the critics.</em> I knew it all on Wednesday
night."</p>

<p>She knew far more, and had no reason to be
sad, when, at the close of the season, after an
extraordinary run, "Romeo and Juliet" was withdrawn.</p>

<p>On October 11, 1882, Shakespearean tragedy
gave way to Shakespearean comedy, and "Much
Ado about Nothing" was staged. We have seen
how, at Leeds, Ellen Terry had tried herself as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
Beatrice. She had proved that the character suited
her to perfection, and confidence in herself no doubt
helped her to make one of the most striking of her
many triumphs.</p>

<p>Clement Scott has such delightful ideas of Ellen
Terry in connection with the character of Beatrice,
that I must be permitted to quote him:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Two passages from 'Much Ado about Nothing,'" he
says, "have always seemed to me to convey
exactly the idea of Ellen Terry, both in youth and
womanhood; they suggest that extraordinary 'charm'
that the actress recently in America was unable
to define, though I, for one, could have embodied it
in two words, 'Ellen Terry.' The passages from
Shakespeare to which I allude are these&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Don Pedro.</span> Will you have me, lady?</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Beatrice.</span> No, my lord, unless I might have another for working
days; your grace is too costly to wear every day. But I beseech
your grace pardon me; I was born to speak all mirth and no
matter.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Don Pedro.</span> Your silence most offends me, and to be merry
best becomes you; for, out of the question, you were born in a
merry hour.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Beatrice.</span> No sure, my lord, my mother cried; but then there
was a star danced, and under that I was born! Cousins, God give
you joy!</p></blockquote>

<p>"Now, if William Shakespeare had had the model
before him, he could not have drawn a more perfect
picture of Ellen Terry than this. She was indeed
'born to speak all mirth and no matter.' If ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
lovely woman was 'born in a merry hour' it was
Ellen Terry, for she can scarcely be serious for an
hour together, and is never happier than when she
is playing some practical joke on her more serious
companions.</p>

<p>"And who, whilst life lasts, can ever forget how
the actress in the character of Beatrice, one of the
most enchanting personations of my time, one of the
most exquisite realisations of a Shakespearean heroine
that any of us have ever seen, spoke those words,
'No sure, my lord, my mother cried; but then there
was a star danced, and under that I was born.'
Why, it was not Beatrice, but Ellen Terry, personated
by Ellen Terry. It was a revelation. The
other quotation from the same play, 'Much Ado
about Nothing,' is Hero's description of her cousin
Beatrice, which is simply Ellen Terry in action.</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">'For look where Beatrice, like a lapwing, runs</div>
  <div class="i0">Close by the ground, to hear our conference.'</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>"Is not this an exact description of the Ellen
Terry movement which others so ludicrously attempt
to imitate? She does not run off the stage, or skip
up the steps of an Italian garden. She simply
floats seemingly on the air. A more exquisitely
graceful movement has never been seen from any
other actress. But Shakespeare has hit it. She
like 'a lapwing runs close by the ground.' It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
the skimming of a bird in the air. Ellen Terry
did that lapwing run to perfection when she was
sent to invite Benedick to dinner, and left him with
the famous chaffing rejoinder&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">'You have no stomach, signior; fare you well.'</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>"And up the marble steps ran the lapwing."</p>

<p>How true this is, all who have been fortunate
enough to witness Ellen Terry's bewitching impersonation
of Beatrice, will acknowledge. It was a
faultless performance, and, as we all know, Henry
Irving was equally happy as Benedick. I need
not say more. "Much Ado about Nothing" was
acted two hundred and twelve times, and might
have continued to run, but the day came when the
Lyceum company had to think seriously of their
departure on their first American tour. With this
in view the piece was withdrawn, and all the plays
in the now rich repertory were carefully revived.
On July 15, 1883, at a benefit performance, Ellen
Terry played the small part of Clementine in
"Robert Macaire," to the Macaire of Henry Irving,
and the Jacques Strop of J. L. Toole. The part was,
of course, beneath her notice, but she undertook it
in a good cause, and her performance must be
recorded in these pages. Irving has always regarded
the character of Macaire with affection, and certainly
he depicts the devil-may-care and by no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
means unamusing robber in effectively lurid tints.
The piece, however, belongs to a bygone age, and
is only interesting to those who, while seeing it,
can conjure up the past.</p>

<p>In October 1883 the whole company sailed for
New York, leaving a great gap in the English
theatrical world. I wonder if they quite realised
how much they would be missed? I have always
found it difficult to make popular actors understand
how fervently they are loved, and of what
value their presence is to those who love them.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class="p4">AT THE LYCEUM THEATRE&mdash;1884-1901</p>


<p>In 1884, flushed with their triumphant American
victories, Henry Irving, Ellen Terry, and their
faithful followers returned to the Lyceum. They
commenced operations with a reproduction of "Much
Ado about Nothing," but this soon gave way to a
long promised revival of "Twelfth Night." This
had given rise to many pleasant expectations. It
was confidently thought that the character of Malvolio
would fit Irving like a glove, and it was
certain that in Ellen Terry we should find the
sweetest of Violas.</p>

<p>In the usual beautiful, tasteful, and costly style
attendant upon a Lyceum production, the piece
was staged on July 8, and why it failed to please
the audience is a mystery that remains unsolved.
It is ridiculous to plead that it was a very hot
night, and that the packed house, through being
uncomfortably warm, became unruly and offensive.
We expect hot weather in July, and those who
object to the interior of a theatre under such conditions
generally stay away. Probably, if there is
any explanation of the matter beyond the blatant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
vulgarity of a disreputable gang of foul first-nighters,
it is that "Twelfth Night," not having
been played for a long time in London, was as
Greek to the ignorant in the house, and was not
understood. Be all this as it may, so much low
behaviour greeted the actor-manager on the fall of
the curtain that he sharply rebuked the coarse-minded
malcontents, saying, "I can't understand
how a company of earnest comedians and admirable
actors, having these three cardinal virtues of actors&mdash;being
sober, clean, and perfect&mdash;and having exercised
their abilities on one of the most difficult of
plays, can have given any cause for dissatisfaction."</p>

<p>Opinions differ as to these after-curtain-fall
demonstrations on the part of disappointed actors.
Probably they had better be omitted, but we all
understand that human nature has its limits of
endurance. The annoyed actor is provoked in the
heat of a miserable moment to reprove insulting
audiences, and one cannot wholly wonder at it. A
writer who, in cold blood, challenges his adverse
critics is very foolish indeed, for he not only advertises
the fact that he has had a whipping, but
has smarted under it. Those who in any way
choose to come before the public challenge criticism.
It cannot be all honey, and if an occasional
dose of vinegar is unpalatable to them they had
better retire into their shells. But there was little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
or no excuse for the rowdies who ridiculed the
Lyceum production of "Twelfth Night."</p>

<p>No doubt the play was in some respects unfortunately cast. The Sir
Toby Belch, the Sir Andrew Aguecheek, the Clown, and the Maria, missed
the humour of their practical joking, and this greatly handicapped
Henry Irving, who had elected to play Malvolio from a somewhat serious
point of view.</p>

<p>After putting the question "Is it a good part?" <cite>Mr. Punch</cite> said
of his performance: "Good enough in its proper place in the piece,
no doubt, but when emphasised, developed, and elevated by an eminent
tragedian holding such a position as does the manager of the Lyceum,
to a height of tragic melodrama, then Malvolio is no longer the
middle-aged, conceited, puritanical donkey who is a fair butt for the
malicious waiting-maid, two stupid sots, and a professional fool, but
he becomes at once a grave and reverend signior, a Grand Duchess's
trusted major-domo, faithfully discharging the duties of which he has
an exaggerated opinion, and the very last person to be the subject of
an idiotic practical joke, the stupidity of which is intensified by its
wanton cruelty. And in the end he gains the public sympathy for his
sufferings, just as Shylock does."</p>

</div>

<p>Whether Henry Irving meant his audiences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
to sympathise with Malvolio is more than I can say. It was certainly
very instructive, as well as very enjoyable, to see the part played
from that point of view.</p>

<p>But however critics might differ with regard to individual
performances in this unappreciated production, concerning Ellen Terry's
Viola there was but one opinion. It was simply charming, being at once
full of fun and vivacity, and clothed with modesty. The performance
ranked with her best Shakespearean impersonations, and it is a thousand
pities that it was not seen oftener. It is interesting to note that the
part of Viola's brother and counterpart, Sebastian, was played by Ellen
Terry's brother, Fred Terry, who was then in the early days of his
successful career. The likeness, both in face, expression, and manner
between the two was remarkable, and the episode of their thus acting
together was very pleasing.</p>

<p>In 1885, after another prosperous tour in America, W. G. Wills'
stage version of "The Vicar of Wakefield" was revived, Ellen Terry now
playing her famous character of Olivia to the Dr. Primrose of Henry
Irving. She repeated her former triumph, and, as the dear old country
parson, he was most happily placed. Since then, the delightful play has
taken a permanent and honoured place in the Lyceum repertory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>In the December of this year, W. G. Wills' adaptation of "Faust" was
staged. Of course I cannot dwell on the splendours of this production.
At the time some of the professed students of Goethe were prone to run
it down, declaring (generally without seeing a representation of it)
that the poem had been turned into a pantomime. These quidnuncs did not
know the necessities of the three hours' traffic of the stage. In spite
of them the striking and artistic acting version of a Titanic work drew
the public, and, as a matter of fact, Henry Irving's enterprise induced
more people to read Goethe than had ever been known. To thousands a
closed book had been opened.</p>

<p>"Faust" had a prolonged run, and how much this was due to the
captivating Margaret of Ellen Terry, Henry Irving (who seemed to revel
in the part of Mephistopheles) would be the first to admit. It was
indeed a performance replete with pathos and poetry, and she alone gave
the indispensable feminine interest to a great work destined to hold
its place upon the stage, and in the minds of all earnest playgoers and
students of the drama.</p>

<p>It was in 1885 that Charles Kelly died, leaving his widow with her
two children, who, under the names of Ailsa Craig and Gordon Craig,
have already done excellent work upon the stage and in other branches
of art.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>With such a lasting success as this on hand, with a rich repertory
to fall back upon, and American tours to interfere with London work,
new productions at the Lyceum now become few and far between.</p>

<p>In 1886, Irving revived one of his favourite old farces, "Raising
the Wind." It was a treat to see him once more enjoying his ingeniously
and comically conceived interpretation of Jeremy Diddler, but the
character of Peggy offered no real opportunity to Ellen Terry. She made
a sweet picture, and it was good-natured of her to act in such a piece,
and that is all that can be said. But it gives an opportunity of noting
how truly great artists are always willing to play small parts. It is
only the self-sufficient semi-amateur who must be Hamlet or nothing.
"I love to be a <em>useful</em> actress," is Ellen Terry's constant
cry.</p>

<p>On July I, 1887, at a benefit performance generously given on behalf
of Dr. Westland Marston, Byron's "Werner" was performed, Henry Irving
playing the gloomy hero to the Josephine of Ellen Terry. It was an
interesting experiment, but, although immense pains were taken over the
production, it was not repeated.</p>

<p>Werner had been a favourite part with Macready, and I can never
think of the piece without recalling an anecdote that was told me by another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
veteran actor of the old school&mdash;Henry Loraine. Loraine and a
brother tragedian had had a difference of opinion concerning the
"gouts" of blood mentioned in "Macbeth"&mdash;in the famous dagger
soliloquy&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0"><span style="margin-left: 10em;">"I see thee still;</span></div>
  <div class="i0">And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood,</div>
  <div class="i0">Which was not so before."</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Was the correct pronunciation of "gout" as here used the same as
the dread malady "gout" from which so many of us suffer? That was
the dispute&mdash;concerning it a small wager was made&mdash;and it
was determined that the great Macready should be the referee. In
his declining days, and a ripe old age, Macready was then living in
peaceful retirement at Cheltenham, and Loraine, who had been an old
comrade of his, called upon him. He was admitted, but he found the once
vigorous man sadly ill and weak. He was lying back in an arm-chair
wistfully gazing at the virile portrait of himself as Werner that has
been made familiar to the public by the print-sellers. On hearing this
friend's name, the old actor endeavoured to rouse himself, and, being
asked the momentous question as to the "gouts," said with animation:
"Of course it is as <em>I</em> always pronounced it,'goots'&mdash;it
rhymes with 'roots,'&mdash;it rhymes with 'roots.'" And then he seemed
to forget his friend's presence, and, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
it were, fading away, fell back in his chair, and, with a deep sigh,
resumed his contemplation of the once active Werner.</p>

<p>In 1887 the opportunity for a new "creation" occurred, and it
is interesting to see how Ellen Terry availed herself of it. To my
friend Alfred C. Calmour I am indebted for the history of his graceful
poetical play "The Amber Heart."</p>

<p>In common with all plays "The Amber Heart" had its vicissitudes.
Indeed, it would be an interesting thing to write a history of
successful plays, and the anxieties of their authors before they were
safely landed for gratifying production. How many pieces have lain
neglected for years until some chance coming in their way disclosed
their merit!</p>

<p>But the troubles of "The Amber Heart" were neither many nor keen.
Written in 1886, the piece was read first of all to Mary Anderson, who,
then in the zenith of her invincible popularity, was playing at the
Lyceum. It was at the suggestion of the ill-fated William Terriss that
the author submitted it to this charming and accomplished lady. Having
heard the play, she was most enthusiastic about it. "Lovely! lovely!"
she repeated after the author had read it; "if it can only be produced
I am sure we shall have a success." But that season's arrangements
having already been fixed gave no chance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
for it. It was then suggested to Ellen Terry, for whom, indeed, it had
originally been written, but who so far had been unable to consider it
because of her existing engagements. However, in reply to the author's
final question as to whether she could seriously entertain it, she
telegraphed, "Yes, with pleasure, to-day at twelve." This was January
6, 1887. The author read the play to her, and she, too, was most
enthusiastic. "I'll do it, I'll do it!" she exclaimed; "I've longed for
such a part." The difficulty, of course, was how to get it done. Ellen
Terry was then playing Margaret in "Faust," and rehearsing other plays
besides, and, of course, she was pledged to the arrangements of Henry
Irving. At length it was decided that it should be produced at the
Haymarket Theatre on May 7th for a matinee. The theatre was arranged
for, and the date advertised, when the already too busy actress found
that she could not fulfil her promise until a month later. This, of
course (and naturally to the intense disappointment of the author),
unsettled everything. The following month the Haymarket passed into
new managerial hands, and so the piece could not be done there. Then,
following his invariable custom, Henry Irving generously stepped
into the breach, and offered his friend, the dramatist, the free use
of the Lyceum for the production. That difficulty was, at length,
satisfactorily settled, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
the casting of the piece was not easily effected. The casting of plays
for tentative performances seldom is. Ultimately, and after an infinity
of trouble, he had good cause to congratulate himself. Ellen Terry, E.
S. Willard, and Beerbohm Tree! Never before, and never since, have this
talented trio appeared together, and the minor parts were played by
excellent actors and actresses. "If I were to write volumes," says my
friend, "I could not say how hard Miss Terry worked to make the piece
a success. Her whole soul was thrown into it." At the rehearsals her
enthusiasm fired her companions. Everything was done most lovingly, and
on the eventful afternoon, June 7, 1887, an audience assembled at the
Lyceum which was almost as unique as the cast of the play. Mrs. Keeley
represented the older generation of actresses, and Miss Mary Moore
the younger, and many, like Ada Cavendish, David James, and William
Terriss, who have since passed away, were present.</p>

<p>Before the curtain went up his heroine wrote to the
dramatist:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You will have a great success, I hope and pray. I believe in
this, and nobody will be so glad then as your sincere friend, Ellen
Terry."</p>

<p>After the first act (which had gone splendidly) he went behind the scenes.
"Oh, dear, dear! how bad I am!" she said, suffering (quite unnecessarily)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
from her usual "first performance" misgivings. "My tongue is parched,
and I can't get a smile out of the part." She was terribly anxious to
make a great success for her author.</p>

<p>At the end of the second act, which was received with rare
enthusiasm, he again saw her. She was crying, for she was still
"Ellaline"&mdash;the heart-broken maiden, whose lover had tired of
her. After a while she smiled through her tears, and said, "I think I
was a little better in that act." Her modest appreciation of what was
acknowledged to be a noble dramatic achievement showed the true nature
of the woman. The effect on the audience in the parting scene at the
end of this act was greater than written description can convey. Mrs.
Keeley declared that, with all her experience, she had never witnessed
anything so fine, and she afterwards wrote to the author: "I am glad
to have lived to see such grand acting as Miss Terry's was yesterday
afternoon."</p>

<p>Then Ellen Terry wrote to him: "I hope you are pleased. I am so
sorry about one thing yesterday. From nervousness my acting of the
first act was strained and artificial, and I confess that I entirely
ruined and <em>missed</em> your first beautiful soliloquy in the second act!
I am <em>truly</em> sorry! I know that you are a good creature, and view all
my efforts from the point of view of my <i>intentions</i> since I succeeded
better in some bits. Although I may never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
play the part again, I never will cease to love the play for its own
sake, and to regard and esteem my friend who wrote it&mdash;<em>for
me</em>&mdash;I do believe."</p>

<p>Poor self-tormenting lady! From first to last she had played the
part to perfection&mdash;and every one but herself knew it. However, in
that charming letter, so characteristic of her modesty, she unwittingly
endowed the author with one of his most esteemed possessions.</p>

<p>He was indeed to be envied! Henry Irving wrote to him: "Yesterday
was a veritable triumph for you and Miss Terry. Her performance was a
lovely, never-to-be-forgotten thing&mdash;beautiful in conception and
perfect in execution." So delighted was he with her success in this
original character that he purchased the play and made her a present of
it. When it is remembered that he took no part in the victory it will
be understood that he is not a selfish actor.</p>

<p>This was doubly proved when in the following year (1888) the piece
was staged for a run in the evening bill, with Hermann Vezin and George
Alexander in the cast. It was again well received, and ran through a
season. Sir Edward Burne-Jones wrote of it:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I went to the Lyceum Theatre yesterday for the third time to see
your beautiful poetic fairy play. It is a most inspiring work to a
painter&mdash;and Miss Terry's performance a revelation of loveliness.
It is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
acting&mdash;it is a glimpse into Nature itself. Is there any one like
her? I think not. I had not been in a theatre for twenty years before I
went to see 'The Amber Heart.'"</p>

<p>Lord Leighton wrote&mdash;"Beautiful!&mdash;beautiful! Acting and
play beautiful! A sweet and abiding memory."</p>

<p>In America the play was received with the same enthusiasm. Miss
Terry wrote as follows after its production in New York: "'The Amber
Heart' went splendidly. It made a distinct sensation, and I wish you
had been there. The people simply love it&mdash;just as they did at
home."</p>

<p>Ellen Terry's next task was in some ways the most difficult she has
been called upon to undertake. When it was known that she was to appear
as Lady Macbeth, those (and they were in an overwhelming majority)
who associated the character with the majestic, awe-inspiring methods
of Mrs. Siddons, and who, going back to the Garrick period, recalled
a formidable-looking picture of Mrs. Yates as the Thane's wife with
forbidding hooped skirts and a dagger remorselessly clutched in each
determined hand, shook their heads, and anticipated failure. How could
the graceful, gracious, tender-eyed, sweet-voiced, gentle Ellen Terry
grasp such a part as this? Stage tradition had claimed Lady Macbeth for
its own, and very few playgoers reflected that, as a matter of fact, it
would be more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
likely that Macbeth would be persuaded by a beautiful and fascinating
wife than he would be commanded by a cold and imperious one. To fight
against these firmly fixed ideas was a most formidable undertaking,
but, anxious though she must have been, Ellen Terry went to work with a
brave heart.</p>

<p>On November 6, 1888, she wrote (from Margate) to her friend, Alfred
C. Calmour:&mdash;</p>

<p>"My holiday is nearly over, and somehow I wish it was just going
to begin! However, I feel pretty content. Since I last saw you I have
been N., S., E., and W. I have seen <em>very few</em> people, and I have
been absorbed by Lady Mac, who is <em>quite unlike</em> her portrait by Mrs.
Siddons! She is <em>most feminine</em>, and altogether, now that I have come
to <em>know the lady well</em>, I think the <em>portrait is much the grander of
the two</em>! But I mean to try at a true <em>likeness</em>, as it is more within
my means. Like a good friend, send on the notes you spoke of&mdash;the
notes on Macbeth. I'm staying here to get away from people and to be
quiet, but I shall come up for your play, 'Widow Winsome,' if you do
it on the 15th. I'm <em>so</em> glad you'll have a good cast. Katie Rorke is
<em>quite</em> the best of our young ones."</p>

<p>Kate Rorke, it will be remembered, commenced her stage career at the
Court Theatre when Ellen Terry was in the first flush of her success as
Olivia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>This clearly shows that she was intent on giving her own original
reading of Lady Macbeth.</p>

<p>Clement Scott has recorded a very interesting conversation that
took place between them after the production. In the course of it she
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Although I know I cannot do what I want to do in this part, I
don't even <em>want</em> to be a 'fiend,' and I <em>can't</em> believe for a moment
that Lady Macbeth did <em>conceive</em> that murder&mdash;that <em>one</em> murder.
Most women break the law during their lives; few women realise the
consequences of what they do to-day.... I do believe that at the end of
that banquet, that poor wretched creature was brought through agony and
sin to repentance, and was forgiven. Surely she called the spirits to
be made bad, because she knew she was not so very bad?"</p>

<p>And in response to the inquiry&mdash;"But was Lady Macbeth good?"
she said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"No, she was not good, but not so much worse than many women you
know.... Was it not nice of an actress&mdash;she sent me Mrs. Siddons'
shoes! not to wear, but to keep. I wish I could have stood in 'em! She
played Lady Macbeth&mdash;<em>her</em> Lady Macbeth, not Shakespeare's; and if
I <em>could</em> I would have done hers, for Shakespeare's Lady Macbeth was a
fool to it. But, at the same time, I don't think I'd even care to try
to imitate her imitators.... I wish I could have seen Helen Faucit in
the part. I do believe she was the rightest, although not to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
looked at by the side of the Siddons portrait as a
single effective figure."</p>

<p>Now all this goes to prove that though Ellen Terry believed that
the "Siddons" view of the character was the most effective from the
theatrical point of view, she was not what Shakespeare meant, and that
she had resolutely determined to give it her own reading.</p>

<p>On the 29th of December 1888, the tragedy was performed before a
crowded, distinguished, and excited audience. What a picture Ellen
Terry looked in her queenly and exquisitely-designed robes and her
long plaits of squirrel-coloured hair! One could understand a man
doing anything at the bidding of such a lovely, commanding, yet
withal winsome creature. This made her influence over Macbeth very
easy of comprehension, and, so far, a great point was gained; but I
remember thinking that night that the new Lady Macbeth seemed, as the
play advanced, to become an encumbrance rather than a support to her
husband, and that she left him to fight his losing battle alone. She
seemed to content herself with presenting an attractive, affectionate,
and devoted wife, who could rule her husband at will, and encouraged
him in his crimes because she thought they would advance his ambition.
Despite her collusion in the series of cruel murders that were designed
to clear the Thane of Cawdor's way to the throne, she was always feminine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
and far sooner than he, she collapsed under the weight of their mutual
guilt.</p>

<p>That the impersonation proved singularly attractive is beyond all
doubt, and it was well summed up in the words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Miss Terry's Lady Macbeth filled every one with wonder and
admiration. As in the case of her Queen Katherine, it seemed a
miracle of energy and dramatic inspiration triumphing over physical
difficulties and habitual associations. The task was herculean, and
even those who objected could not restrain their admiration."</p>

<p>Indeed, we were all heart and soul with Henry Irving, when, at
the fall of the curtain, and in response to ringing cheers, he
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Our dear friend, Ellen Terry, in appearing as Lady Macbeth for the
first time, has undertaken, as you may suppose, a desperate task, but I
think no true lover of art could have witnessed it without <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'beeing'">being</ins> deeply
interested, and without a desire to witness it again."</p>

<p>He was right: his and her admirers came over and over again, and
"Macbeth" was not withdrawn until June 29, 1889.</p>

<p>In the April of 1889 a very interesting event took place. Having
received the royal command, Henry Irving, Ellen Terry, and the Lyceum
Company appeared before Her Majesty Queen Victoria, the Prince and
Princess of Wales, and many other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
members of the Royal Family, at what was for the nonce dubbed the
"Theatre Royal, Sandringham." For the occasion the ballroom had been
converted into a miniature Lyceum, the proscenium and act-drop of the
theatre having been produced on a smaller scale. The following was the
programme:&mdash;</p>

<p>After the performance, Henry Irving and Ellen
Terry had the honour of being presented to Queen
Victoria, who expressed herself with enthusiasm as
to their respective impersonations. Subsequently,
through the Prince of Wales, her Majesty presented
the great actor with a pair of handsome
diamond and gold sleeve-links, and the reigning
Portia with a brooch, as beautiful as it was
costly.</p>

<p>In her next Lyceum part, that of Catherine
Duval, in the revival of Watts Phillips's stirring
French Revolution drama, "The Dead Heart" (Sept.
28, 1889), Ellen Terry did all she had to do with
her usual taste, and evinced much pathos; but the
character afforded her no really great chance. The
occasion was, however, a very interesting one, for
Gordon Craig (Edward Wardell, who had made his
first appearance on the stage in America as the boy
Joey, in "The Fate of Eugene Aram") played
with great skill the part of Arthur, the handsome
son of Catherine, after she had become the wife of
the Count de St. Valery. It was pleasant to see
the mother and son thus playing together, though
looking at her it seemed almost impossible that the
relationship could exist. Indeed, one writer was
induced to predict that the situation would in due
course be reversed, and that Ellen Terry, "blessed
with perennial youth and undecaying beauty, will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
successfully portray a character, in some happily-chosen
drama, in which she will pose as the daughter
of her own son."</p>

<p>On the 20th September 1890, Henry Irving produced
Hermann Merivale's stage-version of Scott's
great story, "The Bride of Lammermoor," entitled
"Ravenswood," in which he played the ill-fated
Edgar, and she was the Lucy Ashton. Here again,
it seemed to me, that her opportunities were few
and far between, though, of course, she seized and
made the most of them whenever they came in
her way, and thus wove wonders out of rather
scant material. In her picturesque costumes she
looked most charming, and she has told me that
she "dearly loved" the part.</p>

<p>In the next production, the famous revival of
"Henry VIII.," in which as far as scenery, costumes,
and general splendour were concerned, the
Lyceum manager excelled himself, the actress made
a veritable <em>tour de force</em>. Her Queen Katherine
was, as Percy Fitzgerald truly said, an <em>astonishing</em>
performance, and took even her greatest admirers
by surprise. She made the same gigantic effort as
she did with Lady Macbeth to interpret a vast
character, and one that might well have seemed
beyond her strength. It did not aim at being the
<i>great</i> Queen Katherine of Sarah Siddons. As in
the former instance, Ellen Terry founded her conception<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
on different lines, and acted up to her own
ideas with marvellous truth and effect. We believed
in, and sympathised with, this earnest and tender-hearted
woman, and hated those who persecuted
her and hunted her down. She could, and did
show irritation, indignation, and hot anger, but
beneath it all she let us see the woman's heart,
and we knew that it was wrongly and cruelly lacerated.
Her victory over those who had pinned
their faith on the Siddons reading of the character
was complete, and, considering the great difficulties
that lay in her path, it was a great one. The
pathetic resignation of her death-scene was a piece
of beautiful acting ever to be remembered.</p>

<p>Among the dainty gentlewomen attendant upon
this heart-touching Queen Katherine was a charming
young lady, who figured in the play-bills as Ailsa
Craig. This was Ellen Terry's daughter and inseparable
companion, Edith Wardell.</p>

<p>From Queen Katherine to Cordelia is a very
far cry, and yet when she felt it to be her duty
to undertake the difficult task Ellen Terry did not
shirk her responsibility to her manager. It is true,
that with the modesty that always goes hand in
hand with true genius, she said that she would like
to resign the character of King Lear's favourite
child to a younger actress, and volunteered to appear
in the character of the Fool. That would have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
such a bewitching interpretation of one of Shakespeare's
most carefully etched characters that it seems
a pity it was lost to us; but Henry Irving was
right in his judgment. He had determined that
his audiences should see Ellen Terry as Cordelia;
they saw her, and rejoiced in a new and striking
triumph.</p>

<p>How vividly I recall that anxious first night of
November 10, 1892. First impressions are generally
the best, and therefore I do not hesitate to repeat
what I wrote in the early hours of the succeeding
November 11:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In penning these lines it is not so much my
intention to enter into critical judgment on our
leading actor's rendering of the most noble and
exacting of Shakespearean characters, but rather to
give my readers some description of one of the most
notable 'first nights' of the modern stage. Under
the Irving sway all first nights are important, but
this one was especially so, for to the present generation
of theatre-goers 'King Lear' is, from an acting
point of view, practically an unknown play. There
can be few amongst us now who can recall Macready's
revival of 1838, that of Phelps in 1845, or Charles
Kean's elaborate production of 1858&mdash;of which it was
said that 'he had equalled his Hamlet and Louis the
Eleventh.' That is exactly what every one hoped
Henry Irving would do. More he could not do.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
Edwin Booth played Lear for a few nights at the
Princess's in 1881&mdash;and it has, fitfully, been seen in
the provinces, but to all intents and purposes the
tragedy has for many years been laid on the shelf.
What was Irving going to do with it? That was
the question asked by every one in the house last
night, and if his performance is to be judged by the
tumultuous applause that greeted his first entrance,
that followed him throughout the play, and that
called and recalled him at the end of each act, he
had done well indeed. And what a house it was!
My comfortable and easily arrived at seat happened
to be in the last row of the stalls, and consequently
I overheard the conversation of the front rows of
the pit&mdash;which has been rightly called the mouth
through which the final verdict of the house is
given. Here were any number of ladies who, bringing
books, refreshments, and camp-stools with them,
had patiently waited for five hours in the pit entrance
of the theatre during a foggy and comfortless November
afternoon in order to obtain good seats, and who
spoke not only cheerfully, but even boastfully, of
their experiences! Such a tribute to the popularity
of the actor is surely noteworthy. It mattered
nothing to them that the fog got into the theatre
and set them coughing, that their camp-stools were
sadly in their way, that the play was a long one,
and some of the 'waits' were tedious. Eleven o'clock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
arrived, and there was still an act to be played, but
their allegiance was as unshaken as their applause
was undiminished. With such a loyal following as
this, Henry Irving has no cause to fear a rival.
The upper parts of the house were packed. Every
available seat in circles and gallery was occupied,
and the private boxes can only be described as
'boiling over.' But the fifteen rows of densely
thronged stalls formed the centre of attraction.
From the first it was noticeable that the house was
almost as much interested in the house as in the
play. Men stood up to see and be seen, and opera-glasses
were as plentiful as blackberries in October.
The eager pittites exchanged surmises and certainties
with regard to celebrities&mdash;and, probably unconscious
of the interest they were arousing, celebrities
displayed themselves to the best possible advantage,
and exchanged greetings with brother and sister
celebrities. To give the names of those present would
be to quote the very pick of the literary, artistic,
scientific, and aristocratic world. That the critics,
reporters, and artists were there in full force, goes
without saying, and most of them seemed busy, some
taking notes of the performance on the stage, others
jotting down the names of the lions among the
audience, and many making lightning-like sketches
of those present, both on the stage and in the auditorium.
But, after all, 'the play's the thing,' and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
it may be briefly said that this was followed with
unflagging interest, and listened to with breathless
silence. By the time this appears in print<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> those
who are interested in things theatrical will have had
an opportunity of reading the critical verdict of our
leading dramatic censors on Henry Irving's Lear,
and Ellen Terry's Cordelia. Whatever the ultimate
popularity of these impersonations may be,
there was but one opinion in the crowded and
brilliant audience of last night. The people seemed
never tired of cheering, and late though the hour
was when the curtain fell, no one moved until
Henry Irving, who throughout the evening looked
'every inch a king,' was compelled to give utterance
to a few well-chosen words of heartfelt thanks.
His first night of 'Lear,' he said, would be one of
the happiest of his memories. A pleasant feature
of the evening was the right loyal welcome given
to Henry Howe, who, now playing the old man,
tenant to Gloster, was the King of France in the
Macready revival of fifty-five years ago."</p>

<p>Ellen Terry has told me that it was one of the
most nervous and anxious first nights she had experienced,
and it might well be so, for the task of all
concerned in this great production was a heavy one.
But though critical opinion differed as to some points
in the representation&mdash;though sapient playgoers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
shook their heads, and, quoting Charles Lamb, declared
that "King Lear" should never be acted,
there was no argument as to the merits of the new
Cordelia. Her maidenly simplicity and delicately
expressed, though manifestly intense, love for her
father touched the right chord, and once more she
won all our hearts. Her initial popularity in the
character continued throughout the long and, I
believe, unprecedented run of the play.</p>

<p>No wonder that Ellen Terry is fond of saying
that she is a "useful" actress to her manager.
That, she declares, has always been her desire, and
while under an engagement she considers it her
duty to play any part that is offered to her and
to do her best with it. Though she will not say
so, I believe I am right in feeling that she is
justifiably proud of having, in quick succession,
succeeded in such widely divergent Shakespearean
characters as the imperious Queen Katherine (a
part in which I am inclined to think she actually
satisfied that fastidious critic&mdash;<em>herself</em>) and the
gentle Cordelia.</p>

<p>And here let me emphasise the fact that she
repudiates the suggestion that it was her ambition
to play Lady Macbeth. She had no desire for the
part, but when called upon to take it she did not
shirk the task.</p>

<p>Her next original impersonation was that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
Fair Rosamund in Lord Tennyson's beautiful play,
"Becket," which was brought out at the Lyceum
on February 6, 1893. It did not tax her strength
very much, but no one who witnessed the impersonation
will forget its exquisite tenderness or her
perfect delivery of such lines as&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"Rainbow, stay,</div>
  <div class="i0">Gleam upon gloom,</div>
  <div class="i0">Bright as my dream,</div>
  <div class="i0">Rainbow, stay!</div>
  <div class="i0">But it passes away,</div>
  <div class="i0">Gloom upon gleam,</div>
  <div class="i0">Dark as my doom&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">O rainbow, stay."</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is a delightful thing to read Tennyson. To
hear his words interpreted by Ellen Terry is a
revelation.</p>

<p>In connection with "Becket," I have another
little story to tell indicative of my heroine's never-ending
unselfishness. Geneviève Ward, who, it will
be remembered, played most magnificently as Queen
Eleanor, has told me how, in that strong and
stormy scene between the jealous Queen and the
luckless Rosamund, the stage moon was wont to
show a little undue favouritism towards the fair
denizen of the bower, flooding her with radiance
and leaving her vindictive visitor in comparative
obscurity. "This," to quote my friend's own words,
"hurt Ellen Terry's sense of justice, and more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
than once she has turned her back upon the
audience, and gently rebuked the too partial moon
by a tragic line thrown into the wings&mdash;'Take it
off me and turn it on Miss Ward.'" Such anecdotes
could be told by all the artists who have appeared
with her, but this one will suffice.</p>

<p>Against this I may tell a counter story. Amongst
Ellen Terry's treasures there is a ring that was
given to her by Geneviève Ward. When she shows
it to her friends, she says, "Queen Eleanor, you
see, is not at all vindictive to Rosamund off the
stage."</p>

<p>When "Becket" had run its course, and pending
another great production, some revivals were
given. Amongst them was Charles Reade's
one-act play&mdash;"Nance Oldfield." Most of us know
the pretty, imaginative story as related by Ellen
Terry's early friend and mentor, Charles Reade.
Mistress Nance Oldfield, it will be remembered,
was one of the earliest and most popular of
English actresses. She made her first appearance
in 1699, and was the darling of the stage until
she died in 1730, and, with nobles supporting
her pall, was laid to rest in Westminster Abbey.
History records of her that she was not only
an admirable actress, but a good and charitable
woman, and it is from this pleasant point of view
that Charles Reade has limned her in his dainty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
little cabinet picture. In his play her mission is
to cure the love that a romantic young man has
conceived for her through seeing her on the stage.
How, in order to do this, she converts herself
from the most charming of women into a veritable
"tom-boyish" hoyden, is known to all who delight
in the graceful and consummate art of Ellen Terry.
When she is playing this part, her vivacity and
high spirits seem to know no bounds, but her
winsomeness always fascinates her audiences. The
little piece is ever followed with intense interest
mingled with much laughter, and the only regret is
that it comes to an all too early end. It lives and
will live as long as Ellen Terry chooses to play it.
By the way, it is on record that a descendant of
the original Mistress Oldfield has said, "Anne Oldfield
herself could not have played the character
better." The part has also been admirably handled
by Geneviève Ward.</p>

<p>Later on, at a special performance at Daly's
Theatre, Ellen Terry appeared in a short piece by
George Moore and "John Oliver Hobbes," entitled
"Journeys End in Lovers Meeting." It was very
interesting; but the little candle soon flickered
out, and the experiment only calls for passing
record.</p>

<p>No doubt, before, and certainly ever since, the
days of Sir Thomas Malory and the printing by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
Caxton of "Morte d'Arthur," the Arthurian legends
have had a fascination for English-thinking folk.
The publication of Tennyson's immortal "Idylls of
the King" added a new zest to the glorious old
romances, and great delight was expressed when
it was announced that Henry Irving and Ellen
Terry were to appear as the blameless King and his
beautiful Queen in a stage version of the familiar,
pathetic, and very human legend of Arthur, Guinevere,
and Lancelot. The project had often been
mooted, and several leading dramatists had been
named as likely to be entrusted with the important
and difficult work, but at last the choice fell on
Comyns Carr, and right well he performed his
task, writing in fluent blank verse, and telling his
story in the true dramatic way.</p>

<p>The play was produced on January 12, 1895,
and made a profound impression. The beauty of the
scenery designed by Sir Edward Burne-Jones, and
the melody of the music that had been composed by
Sir Arthur Sullivan, added much to the reality
of a presentment which, in its way, was one of
the most captivating things ever seen on the stage.
No doubt the production surpassed everything that
had gone before it in the splendour of its setting,
and its effect upon critical audiences. In this connection
it was truly pointed out that it said much
for the power of the principal performers that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
their art was not overwhelmed by the magnificence
of its surroundings. Their triumph as artists was
only the greater because it was won under circumstances
that were really adverse to the actor. The
tendency of these magnificently staged plays is undoubtedly
to make the individual performer wither,
as the composition in its entirety of scenery, grouping,
and accessories grows more and more.</p>

<p>A fault that some playgoers found with "King
Arthur" was that it afforded few acting opportunities
to Henry Irving. The character of the spotless
consort of Guinevere, who stands out so nobly
in the legends and idylls, somehow seemed unsympathetic
when seen upon the stage. Is it, I wonder,
that mixed audiences follow the all-seeing Shakespeare
when he said, "They say best men are
moulded out of faults, and, for the most, become
much more the better for being a little bad?" In
one of his clever plays Sydney Grundy goes so
far as to suggest that such a very good man as King
Arthur might be to an ordinary human being "a
little difficult to live with." If such be the case,
abundant pardon should be meted out to the erring
Guinevere. As for Ellen Terry as Guinevere she
not only looked a perfect picture, but made the
most of every line allotted to her in one of the
most touching and pathetic characters that (outside
Shakespeare) she has been called upon to play.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283</a></span>
Mention of this production would not be complete
without record of the splendid acting of Johnston
Forbes Robertson as Lancelot&mdash;and the striking
effect made by Geneviève Ward as Morgan le Fay.</p>

<p>I cannot think that "King Arthur" lived as
long as it should have done, but I fear it came
at a time when frivolous playgoers were so absorbed
in the dresses and doings of the Giggling Girl&mdash;the
Gurgling Girl&mdash;the Gargling Girl&mdash;or whatever
that volatile and versatile young lady was for the
moment presenting, that they could not do much
homage to Sir Thomas Malory, Lord Tennyson,
Sir Edward Burne-Jones, Sir Arthur Sullivan, and
Sir Henry Irving&mdash;for it was at this period that
our great actor-manager was honoured with his
well-won knighthood.</p>

<p>In the early autumn of 1896 a new Shakespearean
prize was offered to Ellen Terry, and she
eagerly seized upon and materially profited by it.
Contenting himself with the unsympathetic part
of Iachimo (how admirably he played it!), Henry
Irving resolved to revive the far too seldom seen
"Cymbeline," and of course the ideal Imogen was
at hand. "I love the part!" says Ellen Terry
with her infectious enthusiasm, and, loving it, she
brought it out in all its beauty and fragrance just
as the beneficent sun unfolds the petals and extracts
the sweet scent of the rose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>Agreeing as I do with every word he says on
the subject, I must here once more quote my good
friend, Clement Scott:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ellen Terry," he writes, "astonished dramatic
students with her Imogen on September 22, 1896.
Ellen Terry's Imogen was not only a surprise&mdash;it
was a revelation. It may not satisfy the old school,
but it will certainly delight the new. It is not the
reading of Helen Faucit, the best of the Imogens remembered;
it may be picked to pieces by schoolmen
and students; it was of course un-Shakespearean;
but Ellen Terry's Imogen is Ellen Terry with twenty
years or more off her merry shoulders. I can only
describe Ellen Terry's Imogen as her Beatrice mingled
with her Rosalind that might have been.</p>

<p>"No, it was not that; it was Ellen Terry, that
peculiar amalgam of witchery, charm, and wilfulness
which has baffled every critic of her work. I
shall be told that this is not Imogen; but it is
Ellen Terry's Imogen, and she held her audience
in the palm of her hand. Imogen was never played
in like fashion before. The scene in which Imogen
was summoned by her dear milord to Milford Haven
may not be Shakespearean, but it was pure Ellen
Terry at her best.</p>

<p>"She bounds about the stage like a young fawn,
she kisses her hand, she kisses her dear lord's letter,
she is a wilful madcap and a romp. Is this Imogen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
the King's daughter, the serious, thoughtful Imogen
of Shakespeare? Who cares? What does it matter
to the audience? It is the Imogen of Ellen Terry,
and she has undoubtedly made out a good case.</p>

<p>"It may be heresy to the old school to hear an
actress interpolating asides and adding remarks and
breaking in upon the text with charming gestures,
but Ellen Terry does it, and every one loves her
for doing it.</p>

<p>"So far so good for the earlier and middle scenes.
There was a hesitating period, and an Ellen Terry
period; but when we got to the Fidèle scenes then
came the revelation, the touching of the heart, the
true tears. There was only one remark in the house,
'Oh, what a Rosalind she would have made!' And
many added, 'and ought to make.' Here in these
scenes we had comedy of the finest flavour, and
pathos exquisitely true. Few will forget the eminently
Rosalind-like incident of the sword at the
entrance to the cave&mdash;it was the bloody 'kerchief
over again&mdash;and few indeed will fail to admire the
nervous passion, the really eloquent grief, over the
supposed body of the headless Posthumus.</p>

<p>"The success of the Fidèle scenes nerved the
actress to a fresh attack, and in the grand reconciliation
scene she played with the romance and
activity of a girl of eighteen. It was a surprising
effort from first to last; and of all the Shakespearean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
essays of this delightful artist, from her own stand-point,
this was assuredly the best.</p>

<p>"Hitherto I should have said Beatrice; but here
we have Beatrice with the pathetic touches of Rosalind
superadded. Miss Terry is a model Shakespearean
boy; there is no doubt about that, and has
both laughter and tears at her winsome command.</p>

<p>"The loss of such a Rosalind to the stage as
Ellen Terry would, and must have been, has
ever formed a subject for regret with her warmest
and most enthusiastic admirers. If ever woman
lived who displayed in advance the temperament
of Rosalind, it was Ellen Terry. What affection
she would have shown for Celia; what tears would
have been shed, and what anxiety displayed for
Orlando at the wrestling bout; with what incomparable
humour such a Rosalind would have started
on her romantic journey; and oh! the scenes with
Orlando in the forest, the love, the sport, the joyousness,
the masquerading, and the tears, it makes
one almost sad to know and feel what we have
lost in this incomparable Rosalind."</p>

<p>Ellen Terry's performance in "Cymbeline" also
excited the admiration of the French critic, Augustin
Filon, who, in an article in the <i>Débâts</i>, headed "Une
Grande Tragédienne," said that her Imogen prevented
him from seeing the "absurdities" of the
play! Much more than that, she compelled him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
accept them. He had only to open his eyes and
his ears and Imogen was before him. Her style
is marked by a simplicity which, to inexperienced
spectators, may seem the absence of art, but which,
as a matter of fact, is the perfection of art. She
entirely forgets that two thousand persons are following
her movements and listening to her words.
No glance at the audience, no intonation bearing
traces of study, no obvious effort to delight! Désiré
Nisand, referring to the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">débuts</i> of Rachel, remarked,
"This girl showed me that I had never understood
Corneille or Racine." The same might be said of
Ellen Terry, that "noble artist," in regard to
Shakespeare.</p>

<p>Augustin Filon, it will be seen from this, has
little or no patience with those who say that Shakespeare
should be read instead of seen on the stage.
He quotes the lines between Imogen and the
attendant in the bedchamber scene&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"What hour is it?"</div>
  <div class="i0"><span style="margin-left: 8em;">"Almost midnight, madam."</span></div>
  <div class="i0">"If thou canst wake by four o' the clock,</div>
  <div class="i0">I prithee call me."</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The French censor had not hitherto seen the
significance of these words. Ellen Terry's performance
served to enlighten him. "She seemed to say,"
he records, "'Poor girl, it is not your fault if your
mistress has sorrows which deprive her of sleep.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
Unhappy princesses are not the only people in the
world. You need rest; get thee to bed, and if you
oversleep yourself you are already forgiven.' All
this," continues the writer, "is suggested by Ellen
Terry's delivery of this simple speech."</p>

<p>In his interesting book on the English stage the
same critic says: "Ellen Terry has not only been
an incarnation, delicate, moving, impassioned, of
Shakespeare's heroines, but has in her pure and
sweet elocution set the poet's dream to music."</p>

<p>Ellen Terry has, indeed, always found favour,
not only with French critics, but with her sisters
and brothers of the Parisian stage.</p>

<p>Sarah Bernhardt has said of her: "She is perfectly
delightful, and is one of my best friends.
The greatest treat I can give myself, and a pleasure
to which I can look forward for months, is to see
her act. She is as near absolute perfection as any
one can be. In her, English dramatic art has a
splendid exponent."</p>

<p>Again she declared: "Ellen Terry and Henry
Irving are perfect! I adore them!&mdash;particularly the
former. What grace, what ease! It is not acting
at all, but the real character before one's eyes. In
comedy she is unequalled, at any rate in English-speaking
countries, while Henry Irving, in certain
emotional parts, it would be hard to surpass."</p>

<p>Coquelin aîné loves her acting&mdash;"Angélique, très<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
sympathétique, très tendre!" he once cried, after a
glance at her through an opera-glass. "Mais c'est
charmant! Elle a des vraies larmes dans ses yeux!"</p>

<p>By the way, the <i>Saturday Review</i> once instituted
an interesting comparison between Sarah Bernhardt
and Ellen Terry. "The latter," the writer said, "is
to the English stage what the other is to the French.
The two actresses are superficially about as unlike as
may be, and yet their method is radically the same;
or, in other words, they are both true actresses. It
must, of course, be admitted that Ellen Terry has not
yet had such opportunities of displaying her powers
as have fallen to the lot of Sarah Bernhardt; nor
has she yet attained the perfection of art which Sarah
Bernhardt can, when she chooses to take the trouble,
display; but to her, as to Sarah Bernhardt, one may
safely apply the much-misused term of genius. Like
Sarah Bernhardt, Ellen Terry has the semblance of
spontaneousness; and, like her, she is always identified
with every thought and habit of every character
that she represents. There is further likeness between
the two, in that both are excellent both in
tragedy and comedy. It is, however, as Ophelia that
Ellen Terry has won for herself a place in the first
rank of actresses."</p>

<p>It should be noted that this was written in 1879,
long before Ellen Terry had made her subsequent
triumphs in that long list of great characters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
chronicled in these pages. On April 10, 1897, Ellen
Terry was called upon to pit herself against another
famous French actress&mdash;Réjane. This was as
Madame Sans-Gêne in Comyns Carr's excellent
English adaptation of Victorien Sardou and Emile
Moreau's play bearing that name. The ordeal was
a trying one. It had been freely suggested and
honestly thought that the broad comedy of the
character would not be suitable to the methods of
our sweet English actress. She soon put all doubts
to rest, and, in spite of great difficulties, achieved a
success that was in its way unique. Writing after
the performance, William Archer, who always weighs
his words and never unduly praises, said that Ellen
Terry was "a born comedian, and throws herself
with immense gusto into this sympathetic part."</p>

<p>Coquelin, who was present at the first performance,
and who naturally might have been somewhat
biassed in favour of his famous compatriot, was
enthusiastic. Without for a moment undervaluing
the splendid performance of Réjane, he declared that
Ellen Terry had "won his heart." "She is full of
gaiety," he said, "and enters fully into the spirit of
the <i>rôle</i>. Her exquisite freshness in the laundry
scene, when she discomfits that shy conspirator,
Fouché, by putting a hot hissing iron near his cheek,
and her movements in the scene of the Emperor's
study, twenty years later, when she astonishes the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
same Fouché, who has become Duke of Otranto, by
the brilliant schemes which she explains to him, and
which he successfully adopts, stand unsurpassed.
She is natural, bright, impulsive, and embodies the
character from first to last. Sir Henry Irving's
realisation of Napoleon is&mdash;even to a professional
actor&mdash;an astonishing performance. His incarnation
of the great Emperor is superb all through the two
important final acts of the play."</p>

<p>Coming from such a source this is indeed high
praise, and really it seems needless to add to it.
Happily Ellen Terry is still playing the part, and
playing it to perfection. Truly has it been said that
her laughter is as infectious as her sympathy. The
ready tear which springs to the eye at the misfortunes
of the Count de Neipperg is as spontaneous
and as moving as the victorious smile with which
she drives home her sallies against Caroline, Queen
of Naples. If she misses some of that wily petulance
which belongs to Parisian gaminerie, she more
than makes amends by the downright straightforwardness,
the rich flow of humour, and the disinterested
kindness which enter so largely into the
composition of Lefebvre's plebeian and lovable wife.
Madame Sans-Gêne is undoubtedly one of Ellen
Terry's happiest creations.</p>

<p>On the first of January 1898, Laurence Irving's
ambitious, interesting, and in many respects powerful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
play, "Peter the Great," was produced at the
Lyceum. It was essentially "a man's play," and as
the Empress Catherine, Ellen Terry had few chances.
Nevertheless she acted very finely, and the portrait
worthily fills a place in her well-stocked gallery.
She had already appeared with much success in
America in a short piece by the same author,
entitled "Godefroi and Yolande." This had a magnificent
first-night reception, and she has told me
how, when the curtain fell, Henry Irving stepped
forward, and in a few graceful words thanked the
applauding audience for the approval with which
his son's work had been greeted.</p>

<p>"The Medicine Man," the joint work of H. D.
Traill and Robert Hichens, which succeeded "Peter
the Great," proved a great disappointment, and Ellen
Terry's appearance as Sylvia Wynford need only be
mentioned for purposes of record.</p>

<p>In the April of 1899 Laurence Irving was again
to the fore with his excellent English version of
Victorien Sardou's striking play, "Robespierre."
In the character of Clarice de Malucon, Ellen Terry
had not one of her greatest opportunities, but she
acted with her unvarying and invincible charm, and
at once arrested and held the sympathy of her
audiences. It was a sweet and womanly performance.
Her one great scene came with Henry
Irving, and superbly they both played it. It is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
indeed, intensely dramatic. Robespierre discovers
the terrible fact that Clarice's boy, Olivier, whom
he has condemned to the guillotine, is his own son;
and then his one frenzied idea is to save his life.
But, Dictator though he is, he is surrounded by
traitors and suspects; he already knows that his
own life trembles in the balance; the task is a difficult
one, and Olivier obstinately refuses to accept
any favour at his hated hands. Then follows a
scene in which the distracted father and mother
(for after long years of separation and silence they
are now together again) watch the ghastly tumbrils
as they drag their victims to the guillotine, trembling
lest in one of them they should see their
doomed child. During these heartrending moments
of suspense Ellen Terry was assuredly seen at her
best. Henry Irving's triumph as Robespierre was
emphatic.</p>

<p>On April 15, 1901, the long promised production
of "Coriolanus" was staged at the Lyceum. As
long ago as 1879 Henry Irving had announced his
intention of appearing as the noble Roman in company
with Ellen Terry as Volumnia.</p>

<p>At that time a writer said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Some surprise may, perhaps, be felt at the
circumstance that it is in contemplation to assign
the character of Volumnia to Ellen Terry; but the
part is by tradition, and by reason of its intrinsic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
importance, the lawful inheritance of the leading
tragic actress of the company. It was one of Mrs.
Siddons' famous impersonations, though it was complained
she had not the good sense to follow Mrs.
Woffington's example as to her face, and consequently
was on the stage as off, Kemble's sister, not his
mother. No doubt a resolute conscientious employment
of the arts which suggest the autumn of life
will be needed to enable Ellen Terry to enact Henry
Irving's mother, but the part is a very fine one,
and there can be no question that in the hands of
this actress the great scene of the fifth act, in
which the Roman mother's eloquent and impassioned
pleading finally moves the proud heart of her son,
would, in her hands, produce a powerful impression."</p>

<p>Now time has dealt so tenderly with our
charming actress that there was as much need of
this suggested "making up" in 1901 as there had
been in 1879; but she had the good sense not
to overdo it. There was no more reason why the
mother of Coriolanus should be a very old woman
than there was for Mr. Vincent Crummles to convert
himself into a decrepit octogenarian when he was
called upon <i>in loco parentis</i> to bestow the fair hand
of Miss Henrietta Petowker in marriage to Mr.
Lillyvick. The consequence was that, acting the
part with impressive composure, save where intense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
vigour was demanded, she made such a stately
figure as the handsome Roman matron that she
became a treat to the eye as well as to the ear.</p>

<p>For the rest she completely fulfilled the predictions
of the writer of 1879, being admirable
throughout, and especially so in that grand scene
to which he alluded. She played in a more womanly
and gentle vein than was the custom with her
distinguished predecessors in the part, but the
performance was none the less welcome or telling
on that account.</p>

<p>What a wonderful list of impersonations&mdash;from
the prattling Mamillius to the dignified Volumnia!
Has any other actress achieved so much?</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class="p4">ENDINGS</p>


<p>I cannot conclude this volume before recording
the personal impressions that Ellen Terry has made
upon me. It will be feebly done, for what writer
could pen a true word picture of such a beneficently
radiant creature? I am, from my friendship with
her, fully justified in saying (she would call this
one of the fancies of my book, but I know that
it is a fact!) that her chief delights in life are,
in the first place, her power of making her friends
and her associates happy; in the second place, her
own joy in existence. When with her even the
most depressed spirit is buoyed up. Her quick
sympathy and ready interest in the concerns of all
with whom she comes into contact brings sunshine
into their lives. In common with us all she has
had her troubles and anxieties, and upon her the
effect has been to create a keen and ever active
desire to alleviate the distresses and difficulties of
others. Hand in hand with her go encouragement
and consolation. A word of sympathy from her,
coupled with a look from those earnest, eloquent
eyes, is the best tonic in the world. And while she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
can weep with those who weep, she can rejoice with
those who rejoice&mdash;and she loves to rejoice. It may
very safely be said that she never uttered an ill-natured
word concerning a fellow-creature. "Why
should I?" she says, when taxed with this somewhat
unusual trait in her character. "All the
world seems to say kind things about me. I am
happy in knowing it, and thus I love the world
and all who live upon it. Why shouldn't I?"
There certainly is no reason for it, and she may
be convinced that those who have seen her in the
world love her.</p>

<p>Apart from this general, generous, and genial
affection for humankind, her devotion is centred
in her son and daughter. Very pretty it is to see
her motherly pride in their successes, whether
histrionic or artistic. Happily, her tender solicitude
is well rewarded. Both Gordon and Ailsa
Craig are making names for themselves, and doing
work of which any parent might well be proud.</p>

<p>Very vividly she recalls her childish days, and,
with a sympathetic friend, she is by no means
averse to talking of them. It is as pleasant as it
is touching to hear her conjure up memories of her
own parents and to note the true respect, added
to the heartfelt affection, with which she talks of
them. I use the word "respect" advisedly, because,
in these days (and more's the pity), filial "respect"
seems to belong to the past. Possibly, it is as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
much the fault of parents as of children, but in any
case it is a thing to be deplored.</p>

<p>Of course, Ellen Terry's first stage recollection
is her appearance as the infant Mamillius, when
she saw "the Queen Victoria, the Prince Consort,
the Princess Royal, and the Prince of Wales" in
the royal box, and was, as a matter of consequence,
so awestruck that she could hardly articulate her
words. She played this part for one hundred and
two nights without a break&mdash;a marvellous record
for so young a child. This long run of "The
Winter's Tale" showed that even in the "fifties,"
when long runs were almost unknown, a Shakespearean
play, faultlessly staged, and admirably
acted, could attract a prolonged succession of
audiences.</p>

<p>During their engagement with the Charles
Keans, she tells me (by the way, she is never tired
of singing the praises of Mrs. Kean), she and her
sister Kate studied&mdash;ay, and carefully studied&mdash;all
the feminine characters of each play they acted
in. This fact she tries to impress on the countless
young ladies who want to adopt acting as a profession,
and who apply to her for advice. "What
do you know?&mdash;what have you studied?" she asks
them. "Could you, for example, undertake to play
Hero to a Beatrice; Nerissa to a Portia; or Celia
to a Rosalind?" Their almost invariable reply is
that they have studied nothing&mdash;that they have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
only an ambition to "go on the stage." Then she
will advise them to devote themselves to learning
and understanding such parts in case an opportunity
should come in their way.</p>

<p>Poor young ladies! I don't suppose they like
such advice, for assuredly they all want to begin
as Beatrice, Portia, or Rosalind. Neither, I am
sure, are they aware that they lacerate the tender
heart of the great actress because she feels she
can do nothing for them.</p>

<p>No one knows better than Ellen Terry that
life-long devotion to her art is the only way by
which a true actress can reach the goal of her
ambition, and there maintain her place. She maintains,
moreover, that she should be taught to turn
her hand to anything. "When I played Titania
at Bath," she says with a laugh, "I made my own
dress. It was long, and of transparent, clinging
white, all 'crinkled' by washing and wringing."</p>

<p>She limns a pretty little sketch of herself as
she set forth with her father to seek her engagement
with Mademoiselle Albina di Rhona at the
Royalty Theatre. "I borrowed Kate's new bonnet&mdash;pink
silk, trimmed with black lace&mdash;and was
engaged <em>at once</em>. I thought I looked nice in that
bonnet, and father said pink was my colour."</p>

<p>Evidently she thought that her bonnet rather
than herself had found favour with the manageress.</p>

<p>Speaking of her Haymarket engagement she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
declares that she had no <em>real</em> reason to dislike
poor Sothern, and regrets that she ever publicly expressed
a feeling with which we are all familiar, and
which is best described in the words, "I do not like
thee, Dr. Fell." She admits that at this time she
was very good as poor, maliciously maligned Hero,
but she qualifies this little bit of self-commendation
by avowing that she played Lady Touchwood vilely.</p>

<p>Merrily she recalls her appearance as Britannia,
making her entrance up a trap in a huge pearl
which opened to allow her egress. On this occasion
King Edward VII. and Queen Alexandra,
then, of course, the Prince and Princess of Wales,
came to the theatre for the first time since their
marriage, and modestly sat in the shadow of a
large stage-box. Louise Keeley (afterwards Mrs.
Montague Williams) had to sing a song concerning
the "Invisible Prince," and by deftly introducing
a few improvised lines contrived to let the audience
know the state of affairs. Accordingly the uproarious
applause of a loyal house stopped the
performance until the Royal bride and bridegroom
emerged from their obscurity, came to the front
of their box, and gracefully and gratefully bowed
their thanks.</p>

<p>It was an exciting moment for Ellen Terry
when, in 1878, Henry Irving asked her to accept
an engagement at the Lyceum, to play Ophelia.
So far, she had not seen his Hamlet, and to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
so she travelled to Birmingham. His beautiful,
thoughtful, and always human impersonation at
once captivated her. "No other Hamlet," she
enthusiastically exclaims, "have I <em>seen</em>!&mdash;<em>Not in the
same hemisphere!</em> And yet I have seen Charles
Kean, Fechter, Salvini, and Rossi play the part."</p>

<p>Concerning her own successes she is very reticent,
but I think I speak the truth when I say that she
very properly plumes herself on her immediate
triumph as Ophelia, and that she cherishes the lines
of the writer who said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ophelia, then, is an image or personification of
innocent, delicious, feminine youth and beauty, and
she passes before us in the two phases of sanity and
delirium. Ellen Terry presented her in this way.
The embodiment is fully within her reach, and it
is one of the few unmistakably perfect creations
with which dramatic art has illumined literature
and adorned the stage. Ellen Terry was born to
play such a part, and she is perfect in it. There
is no other word for such an achievement."</p>

<p>In speaking of her sister artistes she is always
generous, and often enthusiastic. She holds that
as a pathetic actress there is no one equal to Mrs.
Kendal, and she declares that in purely poetic
characters her sister Marion is not to be excelled.</p>

<p>Indeed, her sympathy with her fellow-workers
is unbounded. In this connection a pretty little
story has been told by the Baroness von Zedlitz<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
concerning a conversation she had with Ellen Terry
with regard to Signora Duse. "Although," said the
eager English actress of the great Italian actress,
"we cannot talk fluently to each other, we became
fast friends on the evening of our first meeting. I
had seen her in the 'Dame aux Camélias,' and was
so overpowered that I sobbed aloud. She heard
that I was present, and asked me after the performance
to come and see her on the stage. Our
meeting was in accordance with our emotional
temperaments. She rushed to me across the stage,
and I fell weeping into her arms. The tears were
a great relief. I could not have expressed my
admiration better than by my tears. Later on we
spent many a pleasant hour together, and I came
to love her as a sister." But much as she loves
her art, and her companions in art, I believe her
chief delight exists in the quiet of the country.
Every one must have a hobby, and her pleasant
pastime is to possess picturesque rural homes that
she can call her own. Thus she is the happy proprietress
of Tower Cottage, Winchelsea; of Smallhythe
Farm, Tenterden; and of Vine Cottage,
Kingston Vale. To one or other of these sweet
spots, surrounded by fragrant country gardens, she
loves to hie herself as often as may be from her
beautiful London home in more prosaic Barkston
Gardens, and in all her houses her chief aim is to
make her friends happy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>For what most people would call the luxuries of
life she seems to care little, but with regard to its
niceties she is pleasingly fastidious. Her furniture
must be in the best of taste, her pictures must be
truly good, and the books that she cherishes must
not only be delicately bound, but "extra illustrated"
by her own hand, and adorned with quaint book-plates,
for which her clever son Gordon Craig is
responsible. Indeed, and as might have been
anticipated, refinement is the essence of her
existence.</p>

<p>So far I have said little of Ellen Terry's successes
in America, and, indeed, they have been a repetition
of her triumphs in England, but, anxious to be
certain of the impression she really created there,
I asked my kind friend, William Winter, the distinguished
<i>doyen</i> of American critics, to give me his
frank opinion. He replies as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Mr. Pemberton</span>,&mdash;Your story of Miss
Ellen Terry's life, and your estimate of her acting,
have not left anything for any one else to say, and yet
your kind wish for a tribute from the present writer
must not be denied. Observation on this subject has
extended over a period of twenty-five years, and
first impressions have only been deepened in the
lapse of time. The actress is great, but the woman
is greater than the actress, and in the final analysis
of Miss Terry's acting, it will be found that her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
enchantment is that of a unique personality. Only
to name the characters that she has made her own&mdash;the
characters in which she is not only unrivalled
but unapproachable&mdash;is to point directly to this
conclusion. Those characters are Ophelia, Portia,
Beatrice, Wills' Olivia, and Goethe's Margaret. She
has played many other parts, and given great
pleasure by the playing of them, and revealed rare
qualities of nature and fine faculties of art: in each
and every one of these, and in others of slighter
fabric and narrower import, her acting has often
afforded, if not invariably the ground for unqualified
applause, at least the means of enjoyment and
always the occasion of thoughtful study; but her
revelation of personality, in a natural embodiment
of ideal womanhood, has never been so ample as in
those five characters just mentioned. She possesses
a marvellously blithe spirit, and, in some of her
moods, she revels in the exuberance of frivolous
humour. With persons of extreme sensibility that
trait&mdash;an almost hysterical propensity for mirth, as
a relief to the strain of serious feeling&mdash;is not unusual;
but ultimately, she is a woman of passionate
heart, of profound tenderness, and of a most ardently
poetic imagination. Nature has been more kind to
her&mdash;more profuse in the liberality of good gifts&mdash;than
to any other woman on the stage in our
time; for it has endowed her with a commanding
yet winsome figure; a stately head, mantled with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
golden hair; a countenance of piquant charm and
exquisite mobility; the grey eyes of genius, through
which a brave, pure and noble soul looks frankly
into the face of all the world; vocal organs of exceptional
power; a voice of delicious cadences and melting
sweetness; symmetry of person and natural grace of
action; and, within the external equipment it has
placed a woman's heart to feel; a woman's unerring
intuition to perceive; the gipsy's freedom of spirit,
that breaks away from all convention; and the poet's
kinship with nature, in everything that is grand
and beautiful. Her acting has revealed her as more
a spirit than a mind; as one who reaches conclusions
instantly, by divination and not by analysis;
as a wonderful, complex creature of nerves and
impulses; wayward in fancy, strange and erratic,
yet lovely with simplicity; and always, at last&mdash;surviving
every vicissitude&mdash;the authentic image of
goodness and truth. Not improbably the actress
believes that she has carefully and deftly reasoned
her way to every effect of inspiration that she produced
in the mad scene of Ophelia, in Margaret's
ecstasy of love, and in Olivia's unspeakably pathetic
surrender; but such effects as those are not planned,
they happen; like some of Shakespeare's own happiest
lines, they rise out of 'Thought's interior sphere'
(as Emerson calls it), and they leap, full-statured,
into an immortality of beauty. Her embodiments
of Beatrice and Portia were more the creatures of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
design, yet into them also the unpremeditated allurement
of her enchanting womanhood found its way,
and the wild heart of Beatrice evoked a tender
sympathy, and the moral grandeur of Portia&mdash;warmed
with human passion&mdash;entranced the feelings
as much as it impressed the mind. Portia, on the
stage, had always been didactic and oratorical until
Miss Ellen Terry played the part, liberating all its
piquant sweetness, alluring loveliness, and passionate
ardour; since which time it has been acted as a
lover, not as a preacher. More to her than to any
one else the stage of to-day owes the benefits
accruing from the growth of a natural style in
acting&mdash;a style which yet does not sacrifice the
ideal, nor degrade poetry to the level of prose. This
style has been caught up and imitated in every
direction&mdash;a thing, however intrinsically desirable,
that never would have happened but for the magical
achievement of her personality, affecting actors no
less than auditors, and making her&mdash;to use a line
from an old poet&mdash;'Mistress of Arts, and Hearts,
and Everything.' This view might be enforced by
particular examination of each of Miss Terry's representative
embodiments, but that process&mdash;which
would require a volume&mdash;is impracticable here. Her
acting is, of course, irregular and uneven&mdash;the under-woods,
full of bramble-roses, not the trim garden,
with its rows of tulips and beds of moss, but it is
all the more potent for that reason. Her first performance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
in America (October 30, 1883) was that
of Queen Henrietta Maria, in Wills' beautiful play
of 'Charles I.,' and the dominion that she then
established over the public mind in this country
has ever since remained unbroken. Her later visits
to America were made in 1884, 1886&mdash;when she
came as a traveller, not to act-1887, 1893, 1895,
and 1899; and now, as these words are written&mdash;in
fervent admiration of rare genius consistently
and continually devoted to great subjects and the
welfare of society as affected by the arts&mdash;she is
once more speeding to these shores, where her
presence will always be honoured and her memory
always cherished.&mdash;Faithfully yours,</p>

</blockquote>

<p>To this it is my great privilege to add a letter
from that charming lady who, coming to us from
America, fascinated us all under her maiden name
of Mary Anderson.</p>
<blockquote>

<p class="center">"<span class="smcap">The Court Farm,<br />
Broadway, Worcestershire</span>,<br />
<i>September 11, 1901</i>.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Pemberton</span>,&mdash;It is delightful to
hear you are writing a life of Ellen Terry. I congratulate
you upon having such a subject for your
next book, and I congratulate her on having you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
to tell her story, so replete with success&mdash;more, with
triumph.</p>

<p>"My first meeting with her was about eighteen
years ago; I had come to England to act, and I
was very young and retiring, and I felt strange
and very home sick. I went to the Lyceum one
night when Sir Henry Irving, then Mr. Irving, was
acting in 'The Merchant of Venice.' I thought the
Lyceum, like most of the London theatres, did not
compare favourably with those of America, either
in size, decoration, or comfort; but when the curtain
arose on that performance, it was a revelation to
me, not only in perfect acting, but in showing me
how a play could be staged. I had seen photographs
of Ellen Terry (none of which really do her justice),
but when she came upon the stage&mdash;floating rather
than walking&mdash;I was enslaved by her grace, her
beauty, and her magnetic influence. She seemed to
me like a radiant creature from some other sphere;
but even she, like everything and everybody during
those few weeks in England, seemed far away and
very strange. There was a knock at the box door,
and there stood the lovely lady herself, with her
graceful white hands held out in cordial welcome.
Many and dear were her phrases; and her good
wishes for my success when I should take possession
of the stage upon which she was then acting,
rang true, and came from a really generous good
will.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>"In an instant I felt she had drawn aside that sad
veil of strangeness. She was indeed the ideal <em>sister</em>
artist. I mention this act of hers as it illustrates
the kind of kind acts she is ever doing. Her heart
is of gold. She has, on the stage as well as off, a
fascination for men; but she has more&mdash;a power of
enkindling real affection and enthusiasm in the hearts
of women. No woman has perhaps more loyal and
devoted women friends, and this, as far as character
and disposition are concerned, is in my estimation
the longest and finest feather in her beautifully
plumed cap.</p>

<p>"Warm greetings to all your home circle from
us both. Ever sincerely yours,</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 6em;">"<span class="smcap">Mary Anderson de Navarro</span>."</span></p></blockquote>

<p>Can I add anything to this? I think not. I
know that in dealing with books of this description
conscientious censors sometimes say they are replete
with eulogy, and offer little or no criticism. If I
extol Ellen Terry I do so with a clear conscience and
a full heart. I can never forget the happy hours
and enlightenment she has given me, and I believe
that all my fellow-playgoers will think that I have
treated my subject from the right point of view.
Why should not our great geniuses of art and literature
know, whilst they are amongst us, that we
appreciate their work, and love them for the sweet
lessons that they teach us?</p>

<p>Happily Ellen Terry is still in the full ripeness
of her great and constantly maturing gifts, and no
thought of her retirement has yet troubled the lovers
and students of the stage. If, in the course of years
to come (and may they be far off), she deserts us
for her dear country cottages, we might well, in
grand chorus, repeat those lovely lines that occur
in "Cymbeline"&mdash;and, in repeating them, recall the
bitter and trembling anxieties that, in order to give
us pleasure, she has undergone&mdash;</p>

work has every prospect of being widely read."</p>
